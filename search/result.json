[{"question": "How did they make cars fall apart in old movies?", "answer": "\nThe 'cab' is hinged round the bottom of the box structure, probably released by Keaton at the appropriate moment, and very likely sprung to assist the demolition.\nThe rest is just balanced on top and will fall at the slightest provocation.\nYou only see it move about 6 feet, so it doesn't have to last long. As I can see no evidence of a rope to pull it [and I don't think painting techniques would be good enough to paint it out afterwards] let's assume someone pushed it from a few yards further back then ran out of frame. It has no engine, of course.\nIf you watch it frame by frame, it's easier to see...\nIn the first 2 frames, all is well so far - except the bonnet/hood isn't quite seated properly. Also note Keaton's hand on the bodywork - that may already be loose [or may be part of the release mechanism]. The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...\n\nBy frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...\nIncidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.\nAfter further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.  \n\nby frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...\nThe seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.\n[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]\n\nKeaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.\n[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]\nFurther evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.\n\nNow we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.\n \nNow we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...\n\nNote he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.\nYou can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45\u00b0, preventing him from sliding forwards.\n  \nAnd that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.\nNote his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.\n\nThat is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction.\nTen minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take.\nRe: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.\nPerhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction.\n\n\nLast bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all...\n\n\nThe front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.\n\nOne final note...\nThe wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.\nThey fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.\nIf they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.  \nIt would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end.\n"}, {"question": "How do they film the mirror scenes in movies?", "answer": "\nIf you look closely, you'll almost always note that the mirror is angled so the camera is out of its view. This is sometimes masked by the actor looking directly into [the reflection of] the camera, which gives the impression that he is looking at himself in the mirror. \nHowever, there are at least two other options for getting a shot in which the camera should, by rights, be visible but isn't:\n\none is using visual effects (optical or CGI) for the reflection.\nThe other was used by James Cameron in Terminator 2: Cameron wanted a tracking\nshot (camera moving sideways) behind Linda Hamilton removing a chip\nfrom Arnold's head in front of a mirror. If done with a mirror, the\ncamera would have been visible as it moved around behind the actors.\nRather than do this with effects, the set was built so that the mirror was actually a window, and on the other side was a complete mirror-image version of the set on the camera side. Schwarzenegger and Linda sat on the far side facing the camera, and a fancy Arnold puppet and Linda's twin sister sat with their backs to the camera, mimicking all of the moves of their counterparts.\n\nOther examples of this are:   \n\nIn the case of Being John Malkovich, where the shot was from his POV \nthe camera man just stood in front of an empty frame in the wall with\nMalkovich standing 'inside' the wall on a reverse set of the scene...\nIn the bad attempt of Sucker Punch scene in the dressing room when Sweet Pea, Rocket and Blondie talk about not helping Baby Doll, their movements not matching their mirror images (especially Sweet Pea's). Doubles are being used. This is done so the camera can move behind them without being reflected.

It's a stylistic choice, that both sells the rebels image, that they fly against convention, and the cyber punk look from futuristic stories like Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. \nWhen Morpheus meets Neo, he is wearing sunglasses, despite being inside a house during a rainy night. It's just meant to look cool. They'll shed the shades and trench coats when they need to be more practical.\nTrinity in particular also uses her sunglasses as eye protection when riding a motorcycle twice, both in the first and second movie.\nFor the agents, it's another deal altogether. They wear it as a disguise. An additional layer of impersonality. It's standard MIB fantasy clothing. A dark suit and shades.\nTo the best of my knowledge, the Wachowskis never commented on the shades in particular, but I'll leave here a nugget about shades:\n\nPsychologist Paul Ekman, an authority on facial expressions, says that of the 23 facial expressions relating to human emotion, about one-third involve the eyes.

For example:\n\nFilms where a villain \"wins\" by physically or literally defeating a good guy.\nFilms where a villain \"wins\" by psychologically defeating a good guy\nWhat exactly is a good guy versus a bad guy.\nWhat exactly does winning mean?\n\nNow, the first film that comes to my mind when I think of villains winning is Seven. In it, two police officers hunt down a criminal who is murdering people based on the seven deadly sins. The film ends with the \"bad guy\" manipulated one of the good guys into killed him, thus fulfilling the \"final\" deadly sin.\nIs this a win? I would consider it so. The good guy's morality was damaged and the bad guy got what he wanted - even if it meant his death. Therefore, I'd consider this under Option 2 above - psychologically defeating the good guy.\nAnother famous example is No Country for Old Men, where the \"good guy\" comes across a lot of money at the start of the film, and spends the film avoiding a hitman who is after him for it. He doesn't succeed. He is killed towards the end of the film. We see the hitman get involved in a car crash. He could have died. Instead, he recovers and walks away.\nSo the good guy is dead, the bad guy survives and walks away. A very clear example of Option 1.\nSimilarly, The Usual Suspects would fall down this road. But what about The Empire Strikes Back? Or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince?. Or The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The \"bad guys\" certainly won at the end of those films - but do those count, since they were part of an overall series where the good guys won?\nWhen looking at Option 3, I mention the difficulty in defining good and bad. In years gone by, black and white hat symbolism could make this a simple task. But in modern media, it's increasingly difficult. Take a show like Game of Thrones - how does one determine who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\"? Everyone will have their own subjective opinion.\nAnd what about horror films? Quite a few of the Saw films end with the bad guy winning. Many other horror films do. Do we count these?\nSimilarly, what about Option 4? What is winning. Does Amy win at the end of Gone Girl, a film about a woman who intentionally disappears to heap suspicion on her husband, but returns when it backfires (having murdered another person) and forced him into a situation where he must stay with her. Did they both lose? What about Nightcrawler, where a stringer who films live footage of crimes sets up a scene to kill his partner, so he can film it. He was the protagonist of the film, but that didn't make the creepy ending to this film any more comfortable - but it wasn't supposed to be comfortable.\nThere is a lot of subjectivity around all of this.\nTherefore, I'd propose to set aside Points 3 and 4 for now. If we just focus on obvious examples of victory, through defeating the good guy or psychologically breaking him, there are a number of fascinating reasons why a film might let a bad guy win:\nUnexpected\nIt is unexpected for bad guys to win. We got to the films, and watch TV, to be entertained. Often this involves rooting for the good guys, as many of us identify as good ourselves. Of course, these guys might be rogues (like Captain Jack Sparrow, Han Solo), but their characters are written in such a way as to be interesting, relateable and fun.\nWhen the tables are turned and the good guy loses, it suddenly becomes unexpected and adds shock value.\nCliffhangers\nTake a show like Mortal Kombat: Conquest. Its first series ended with almost all the good guys dying. The intention was a second series would have resolved this (supposedly by making the first series ending a dream). However, the show was cancelled. So for all of time, there is a depressing ending!\nThere are slightly different examples like I mentioned above, where films that are part of an overall story arc can have cliffhanger endings where the \"bad guys\" win - although this is often to set the good guys up for an even bigger win later on.\nRealism\nFilms like No Country for Old Men displayed \"bad guys\" winning because it was a genuinely realistic finale that was intended to both shock and horrify. And it worked, brilliantly. \nHistorically accurate\nImagine an infamous criminal from modern or historical times who got rich, lived happy and survived until old age. He has technically \"won\" (and quite possibly defeated many good guys along the way). However, as this is a film that's historically accurate this \"victory\" will be shown, even if people watching the film find it distasteful.\nSo how do audiences react?\nThis is very difficulty to objectively judge. Are we basing this on critic reviews? On box office revenue? For films like The Usual Suspects and Seven, they reacted brilliantly. The endings are adored. For others, they are not.\nConclusion:\nUltimately, there are plenty of films where the bad guys win.\nHowever, the biggest problem I believe for studios in deciding whether the \"bad guy\" should win, is understanding why he is wanted to win. If it is just \"for fun\", they're much less likely to do it. If it's for a twist ending, for shock value, to reflect the brutality of a situation, or to set up an ending for a later, more positive film - then it's much more likely to be acceptable.\nFilm studios do care about audience opinion. If they feel the audience will appreciate the ending or if it fits with the theme of the story, then they'll proceed with it.\n"}, {"question": "Is the title \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d singular or plural?", "answer": "\nIt's quite ambiguous, and fortunately so!\nAs shown by existing answers, director Rian Johnson seems to have a clear answer to the question, but that doesn't make the title of his movie less ambiguous, especially since many of the film's official translations deviate from his opinion (neither do we know who was ultimately responsible for the title anyway). Of course the decisions of whatever international marketing division aren't necessarily more significant than the director's interpretation either, but this unclarity even among the official channels adds to the high ambiguity of the original title. Seeing how that ambiguity is  just centred around the specificities of the English language and the declination of a fictitious word, it might be entirely coincidental and not intended by the film-makers at all, but it is still very much there, and quite apparently so (as your question and the interest it generates shows afterall).\nWe could argue if Luke Skywalker is the only Jedi left or if there are technically other Jedi around. But this is also made quite difficult by the unclarity what a \"Jedi\" actually is (which isn't helped by the institutionalized arm of the Jedi having been destroyed with the rise of the Empire at the end of the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy bringing much more of the fuzzy mysticism back into the Jedi idea). Is it any force sensitive person? Is it some force sensitive gal carrying a bunch old Jedi codices around with her? Or is it only someone who went through a proper 4 year B.Sc. programme in Jedi?\nBut the ambiguity doesn't just end there. As other answers have shown, the films themselves do indeed use these words (in the title sequences as well as in dialogue) to describe a specific individual with them, Luke Skywalker that is. But then again, the mere fact that Luke might indeed be the last of the Jedi makes him also pretty much a representative of the very Jedi religion itself. So he might very well incorporate singular and plural in unison.\nBut beyond arguing about what a Jedi is, how many there are left, or what whoever from Disney thinks the title refers to, there is a strong theme of ending/renewing the era of the Jedi that drives itself through the movie. Afterall, Luke himself (at least initially) wants the Jedi to end for having grown arrogant and Kylo Ren actually agrees with him in that (as does Yoda to some degree). Although, the film isn't entirely uncompromising in its \"out with the old one, in with the new one\" attitude, especially when it has Rey save the old Jedi codices, there is a strong sense of, if not ending, then at least renewing or revising the Jedi idea. And you might argue that the notion of the entire Jedi era ending is represented more by the plural than by the singular, but that alone could very well just be a subjective impression, too.\nWhat all these ramblings are hopefully showing is that this isn't really a simple question to answer. But it's also not a simple question to ask either, seeing how the ambiguity adds to the theme of ending the Jedi as well as, in its referral to Luke himself, to the question what Luke actually means for the Jedi as a whole and ultimately to the question what \"Jedi\" and being a Jedi really means, nothing of which is simple to answer. So even if that looks like a lame excuse, we might just resort to the platitude that the question itself is the answer. Coincidental or not, it's a really interesting question and Rian Johnson might either have been joking or a little bit too dismissive in his judgment of it. ;-)\n"}, {"question": "Why cast an A-lister for Groot?", "answer": "\nA-list actors are supposed to be \"bankable stars\", so it makes sense that directors/producers would want one in their movie.\nBut Vin Diesel wasn't the first to audition for the role, as revealed by James Gunn:\n\nAll of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very\n  good at all, they sounded like shit. It just didn't really work. \nThen\n  Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks,\n  and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with every 'I am\n  Groot,' exactly what he was saying \u2026 \nThen Vin would sit there and he\n  would do it and he would it again and again and again, and his voice\n  is so rich and so beautiful and he really opened up and was this\n  character. It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how\n  much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\n\nAnd Vin Diesel had this to say:\n\nI was lucky that I had a director [James Gunn] who was willing to\n  indulge me. I told him: \n\n\u2018We know that Groot is really saying any\n    number of things when he says that line and most people are oblivious\n    to the nuances of his speech because of his hardened larynx\u2019. \n\nAll you\n  hear is the growl but he could be saying any number of things and we\n  know that Rocket Raccoon understands him. He doesn\u2019t always tell\n  everybody he understands Groot and he plays on that, but he does\n  understand him. \nSo I asked James: \n\n\u2018Can you give me a basic idea of\n    what he\u2019s trying to say when he\u2019s saying \u201cI am Groot\u201d?\u2019\n\nJames had a\n  50-page document waiting for me when I came in to do the voice. On the\n  left-hand side of the page it said \u2018I am Groot\u2019 and on the right-hand\n  side it had whatever the line really was if you could understand this\n  floral colossus.

Our interpreter guy, esekherif, translated it that way and I think this is the closest that Turkish language can possibly get.\nJapanese: \"\u30db\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\" [Ho-da-] which is a transliteration of \"Hodor\", coming from the English \"Hold the Door\". Interestingly in Japanese, door is pronounced \u30c9\u30a2 (doa) which if transliterated as such would make the name a lot closer to the English pronunciation. In Japanese, \"hold the door\" would be \u30c9\u30a2\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066 (doa wo motte) which would have more chance of making his name something like \u30c9\u30a2\u30e2 (Doamo) in a purely Japanese version.\nBrazilian Portuguese: \"Segure a porta\" (\"Hold the door\") -> \"a por-\" -> \"Hodor\"\nItalian: First shown in English with italian subtitles (literal), then in Italian with integral translation after one week. Translators decided for a little addition to maintain the original meaning and then make the \"Hodor\" works: \"Blocca la porta, trova un modo!\" (Hold the door, find a way!) -> trova un modo -> rov...odo.. -> hodor\nDanish: \"Hold d\u00f8ren!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nSwedish: \"H\u00e5ll d\u00f6rren!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nNorwegian: \"Hold d\u00f8ra!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nFinnish: \"Pitele ovea!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nSerbian: \"Hodi, dobro dr\u017ei vrata!\" (\"Come on, hold the door tightly...\")... then \"Hodi... dobro...\" (\"Come on... tightly...\"), then just  \"hodor...\". Alliteration was preserved as much as possible, while it's obviously not the best way to say it.\nCzech: \u201cDr\u017e vrata! Honem!\u201d (\u201cHold the gate!

It sounds nothing like Hodor, so from one point on they used greek letters to write \"Hold The Door\" (\u03a7\u03bf\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1) which eventually became \"\u03a7\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\".

In Western culture, we read from\n  left to right, and we watch theater and television that way, too. Our\n  eyes end up on the right side of the screen\u2014where the host sits (also\n  known as stage left). In the theory of stagecraft, it's understood\n  that a rightward placement telegraphs royalty. So no matter how famous\n  the guest may be, sitting to the left makes him or her seem\n  subservient. Late-night hosts also sit slightly upstage (farther back\n  and slightly elevated) from their guests, which likewise reinforces\n  the notion of a power imbalance.\nStage designers hold that guests make a stronger impression if they\n  enter from stage left, crossing in front of the host and shifting the\n  audience's focus ever so briefly. Perhaps that's why David\n  Letterman\u2014famous for the occasional cutting takedown\u2014makes his guests\n  march in from the weaker stage right.

On The Graham Norton Show, there is no desk.\n  Norton sits to the left of his guests, who share a single long couch.\n[...]\nBravo's raucous Watch What Happens: Live has perhaps the most unique\n  set of any American late-night show.

The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...\n\nBy frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...\nIncidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.\nAfter further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.  \n\nby frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...\nThe seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.\n[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]\n\nKeaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.\n[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]\nFurther evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.\n\nNow we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.\n \nNow we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...\n\nNote he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.\nYou can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45\u00b0, preventing him from sliding forwards.\n  \nAnd that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.\nNote his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.\n\nThat is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction.\nTen minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take.\nRe: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.\nPerhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction.\n\n\nLast bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all...\n\n\nThe front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.\n\nOne final note...\nThe wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.\nThey fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.\nIf they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.  \nIt would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end.\n"}, {"question": "How do they film the mirror scenes in movies?", "answer": "\nIf you look closely, you'll almost always note that the mirror is angled so the camera is out of its view. This is sometimes masked by the actor looking directly into [the reflection of] the camera, which gives the impression that he is looking at himself in the mirror. \nHowever, there are at least two other options for getting a shot in which the camera should, by rights, be visible but isn't:\n\none is using visual effects (optical or CGI) for the reflection.\nThe other was used by James Cameron in Terminator 2: Cameron wanted a tracking\nshot (camera moving sideways) behind Linda Hamilton removing a chip\nfrom Arnold's head in front of a mirror. If done with a mirror, the\ncamera would have been visible as it moved around behind the actors.\nRather than do this with effects, the set was built so that the mirror was actually a window, and on the other side was a complete mirror-image version of the set on the camera side. Schwarzenegger and Linda sat on the far side facing the camera, and a fancy Arnold puppet and Linda's twin sister sat with their backs to the camera, mimicking all of the moves of their counterparts.\n\nOther examples of this are:   \n\nIn the case of Being John Malkovich, where the shot was from his POV \nthe camera man just stood in front of an empty frame in the wall with\nMalkovich standing 'inside' the wall on a reverse set of the scene...\nIn the bad attempt of Sucker Punch scene in the dressing room when Sweet Pea, Rocket and Blondie talk about not helping Baby Doll, their movements not matching their mirror images (especially Sweet Pea's). Doubles are being used. This is done so the camera can move behind them without being reflected.

For example:\n\nFilms where a villain \"wins\" by physically or literally defeating a good guy.\nFilms where a villain \"wins\" by psychologically defeating a good guy\nWhat exactly is a good guy versus a bad guy.\nWhat exactly does winning mean?\n\nNow, the first film that comes to my mind when I think of villains winning is Seven. In it, two police officers hunt down a criminal who is murdering people based on the seven deadly sins. The film ends with the \"bad guy\" manipulated one of the good guys into killed him, thus fulfilling the \"final\" deadly sin.\nIs this a win? I would consider it so. The good guy's morality was damaged and the bad guy got what he wanted - even if it meant his death. Therefore, I'd consider this under Option 2 above - psychologically defeating the good guy.\nAnother famous example is No Country for Old Men, where the \"good guy\" comes across a lot of money at the start of the film, and spends the film avoiding a hitman who is after him for it. He doesn't succeed. He is killed towards the end of the film. We see the hitman get involved in a car crash. He could have died. Instead, he recovers and walks away.\nSo the good guy is dead, the bad guy survives and walks away. A very clear example of Option 1.\nSimilarly, The Usual Suspects would fall down this road. But what about The Empire Strikes Back? Or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince?. Or The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The \"bad guys\" certainly won at the end of those films - but do those count, since they were part of an overall series where the good guys won?\nWhen looking at Option 3, I mention the difficulty in defining good and bad. In years gone by, black and white hat symbolism could make this a simple task. But in modern media, it's increasingly difficult. Take a show like Game of Thrones - how does one determine who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\"? Everyone will have their own subjective opinion.\nAnd what about horror films? Quite a few of the Saw films end with the bad guy winning. Many other horror films do. Do we count these?\nSimilarly, what about Option 4? What is winning. Does Amy win at the end of Gone Girl, a film about a woman who intentionally disappears to heap suspicion on her husband, but returns when it backfires (having murdered another person) and forced him into a situation where he must stay with her. Did they both lose? What about Nightcrawler, where a stringer who films live footage of crimes sets up a scene to kill his partner, so he can film it. He was the protagonist of the film, but that didn't make the creepy ending to this film any more comfortable - but it wasn't supposed to be comfortable.\nThere is a lot of subjectivity around all of this.\nTherefore, I'd propose to set aside Points 3 and 4 for now. If we just focus on obvious examples of victory, through defeating the good guy or psychologically breaking him, there are a number of fascinating reasons why a film might let a bad guy win:\nUnexpected\nIt is unexpected for bad guys to win. We got to the films, and watch TV, to be entertained. Often this involves rooting for the good guys, as many of us identify as good ourselves. Of course, these guys might be rogues (like Captain Jack Sparrow, Han Solo), but their characters are written in such a way as to be interesting, relateable and fun.\nWhen the tables are turned and the good guy loses, it suddenly becomes unexpected and adds shock value.\nCliffhangers\nTake a show like Mortal Kombat: Conquest. Its first series ended with almost all the good guys dying. The intention was a second series would have resolved this (supposedly by making the first series ending a dream). However, the show was cancelled. So for all of time, there is a depressing ending!\nThere are slightly different examples like I mentioned above, where films that are part of an overall story arc can have cliffhanger endings where the \"bad guys\" win - although this is often to set the good guys up for an even bigger win later on.\nRealism\nFilms like No Country for Old Men displayed \"bad guys\" winning because it was a genuinely realistic finale that was intended to both shock and horrify. And it worked, brilliantly. \nHistorically accurate\nImagine an infamous criminal from modern or historical times who got rich, lived happy and survived until old age. He has technically \"won\" (and quite possibly defeated many good guys along the way). However, as this is a film that's historically accurate this \"victory\" will be shown, even if people watching the film find it distasteful.\nSo how do audiences react?\nThis is very difficulty to objectively judge. Are we basing this on critic reviews? On box office revenue? For films like The Usual Suspects and Seven, they reacted brilliantly. The endings are adored. For others, they are not.\nConclusion:\nUltimately, there are plenty of films where the bad guys win.\nHowever, the biggest problem I believe for studios in deciding whether the \"bad guy\" should win, is understanding why he is wanted to win. If it is just \"for fun\", they're much less likely to do it. If it's for a twist ending, for shock value, to reflect the brutality of a situation, or to set up an ending for a later, more positive film - then it's much more likely to be acceptable.\nFilm studios do care about audience opinion. If they feel the audience will appreciate the ending or if it fits with the theme of the story, then they'll proceed with it.\n"}, {"question": "Is the title \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d singular or plural?", "answer": "\nIt's quite ambiguous, and fortunately so!\nAs shown by existing answers, director Rian Johnson seems to have a clear answer to the question, but that doesn't make the title of his movie less ambiguous, especially since many of the film's official translations deviate from his opinion (neither do we know who was ultimately responsible for the title anyway). Of course the decisions of whatever international marketing division aren't necessarily more significant than the director's interpretation either, but this unclarity even among the official channels adds to the high ambiguity of the original title. Seeing how that ambiguity is  just centred around the specificities of the English language and the declination of a fictitious word, it might be entirely coincidental and not intended by the film-makers at all, but it is still very much there, and quite apparently so (as your question and the interest it generates shows afterall).\nWe could argue if Luke Skywalker is the only Jedi left or if there are technically other Jedi around. But this is also made quite difficult by the unclarity what a \"Jedi\" actually is (which isn't helped by the institutionalized arm of the Jedi having been destroyed with the rise of the Empire at the end of the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy bringing much more of the fuzzy mysticism back into the Jedi idea). Is it any force sensitive person? Is it some force sensitive gal carrying a bunch old Jedi codices around with her? Or is it only someone who went through a proper 4 year B.Sc. programme in Jedi?\nBut the ambiguity doesn't just end there. As other answers have shown, the films themselves do indeed use these words (in the title sequences as well as in dialogue) to describe a specific individual with them, Luke Skywalker that is. But then again, the mere fact that Luke might indeed be the last of the Jedi makes him also pretty much a representative of the very Jedi religion itself. So he might very well incorporate singular and plural in unison.\nBut beyond arguing about what a Jedi is, how many there are left, or what whoever from Disney thinks the title refers to, there is a strong theme of ending/renewing the era of the Jedi that drives itself through the movie. Afterall, Luke himself (at least initially) wants the Jedi to end for having grown arrogant and Kylo Ren actually agrees with him in that (as does Yoda to some degree). Although, the film isn't entirely uncompromising in its \"out with the old one, in with the new one\" attitude, especially when it has Rey save the old Jedi codices, there is a strong sense of, if not ending, then at least renewing or revising the Jedi idea. And you might argue that the notion of the entire Jedi era ending is represented more by the plural than by the singular, but that alone could very well just be a subjective impression, too.\nWhat all these ramblings are hopefully showing is that this isn't really a simple question to answer. But it's also not a simple question to ask either, seeing how the ambiguity adds to the theme of ending the Jedi as well as, in its referral to Luke himself, to the question what Luke actually means for the Jedi as a whole and ultimately to the question what \"Jedi\" and being a Jedi really means, nothing of which is simple to answer. So even if that looks like a lame excuse, we might just resort to the platitude that the question itself is the answer. Coincidental or not, it's a really interesting question and Rian Johnson might either have been joking or a little bit too dismissive in his judgment of it. ;-)\n"}, {"question": "Why cast an A-lister for Groot?", "answer": "\nA-list actors are supposed to be \"bankable stars\", so it makes sense that directors/producers would want one in their movie.\nBut Vin Diesel wasn't the first to audition for the role, as revealed by James Gunn:\n\nAll of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very\n  good at all, they sounded like shit.

Interestingly in Japanese, door is pronounced \u30c9\u30a2 (doa) which if transliterated as such would make the name a lot closer to the English pronunciation. In Japanese, \"hold the door\" would be \u30c9\u30a2\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066 (doa wo motte) which would have more chance of making his name something like \u30c9\u30a2\u30e2 (Doamo) in a purely Japanese version.\nBrazilian Portuguese: \"Segure a porta\" (\"Hold the door\") -> \"a por-\" -> \"Hodor\"\nItalian: First shown in English with italian subtitles (literal), then in Italian with integral translation after one week. Translators decided for a little addition to maintain the original meaning and then make the \"Hodor\" works: \"Blocca la porta, trova un modo!\" (Hold the door, find a way!) -> trova un modo -> rov...odo.. -> hodor\nDanish: \"Hold d\u00f8ren!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nSwedish: \"H\u00e5ll d\u00f6rren!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nNorwegian: \"Hold d\u00f8ra!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nFinnish: \"Pitele ovea!\" (subtitles, literal translation, no attempt to preserve alliteration).\nSerbian: \"Hodi, dobro dr\u017ei vrata!\" (\"Come on, hold the door tightly...\")... then \"Hodi... dobro...\" (\"Come on... tightly...\"), then just  \"hodor...\". Alliteration was preserved as much as possible, while it's obviously not the best way to say it.\nCzech: \u201cDr\u017e vrata! Honem!\u201d (\u201cHold the gate!

In Western culture, we read from\n  left to right, and we watch theater and television that way, too. Our\n  eyes end up on the right side of the screen\u2014where the host sits (also\n  known as stage left). In the theory of stagecraft, it's understood\n  that a rightward placement telegraphs royalty. So no matter how famous\n  the guest may be, sitting to the left makes him or her seem\n  subservient. Late-night hosts also sit slightly upstage (farther back\n  and slightly elevated) from their guests, which likewise reinforces\n  the notion of a power imbalance.\nStage designers hold that guests make a stronger impression if they\n  enter from stage left, crossing in front of the host and shifting the\n  audience's focus ever so briefly.

Also, bear in mind, you're \"dead\" so not doing much in the way of running around getting out of breath.\nZombies would be a whole different question and answer ;)\nThe idea is that you reduce the carbon dioxide levels and slightly increase oxygen levels in your lungs, reducing the urgency to breathe again quite so quickly.\nIt's also helpful if you're in place a good few minutes before the take, so you have time to relax and not have just rushed to set at the last minute, already breathless.\nSo, as you hear the 1st AD prepping for the take you breathe big and deep for 5 - 10 seconds.

At other times you can, of course, breathe shallowly until you know you're in frame. If you're not sure and you think it might be significant - ask. Someone can count you through a rehearsal.\nThe other thing to note, from an audience perspective, is that long 3-minute scene where you were amazed at the corpse not breathing for the whole thing probably took a day to shoot. He probably had to not breathe for no more than 30 seconds in any individual take. \n[1] The \"and\" before Action is often significant and highly emphasised.

You don't have the lungful of oxygen in reserve and the rise in carbon dioxide is more concentrated.\nIf you didn't know already, the \"urgency to breathe\" reflex is not triggered by lack of oxygen, but by increase in carbon dioxide concentration.\n"}, {"question": "Why did filmmakers need permission to film in black and white?", "answer": "\n\nWhy did Mel Brooks need to get permission to film in black and white? \n\nBecause it would, in most studio executive's minds, make the movie less commercially viable.\n\n\nWho did he need to get permission from?\n\nEssentially, the studio..the company/people paying to make it.\nFinancing is generally arranged through studios and production companies. The executives of those companies want to make sure they are investing in a 'product' that will be commercially sucessful and will ask for changes if they feel the 'product' is threatened.\nIn some cases, depending on the contracts, studios have been known to take pictures away from directors (see Blade Runner). Getting permission beforehand is essential.\n\nWith The Elephant Man, Brooks defied studio convention by hiring an avant-garde director to helm a major production, shooting the film in black and white, and refusing to allow studio brass to tamper with Lynch's vision. When shown a cut of the film, Paramount executives recommended that the surreal opening and closing sequences be removed from the film. According to Cornfeld, Brooks tersely responded, \"We are involved in a business venture. We screened the film for you to bring you up to date as to the status of that venture.

Yes it is an interesting theory, but whilst it is certainly a deliberate action from the writers/director - the meaning is not completely clear.  Cobb clearly seems to treat the spinning top as his totem (flawed or not), as he uses it when flustered by his dream in Mombassa.  So yes, it could be a clue, it could even be his true or second totem - but it is still not completely reliable in my opinion.\nSo is Cobb in a dream at the end? I don't think we can tell.  Unlike the other answer, I like the ambiguity in the movie.  If pushed to give an answer I would say that the fact that he is such an experienced shared dreamer, it seems likely that he would eventually work out if he is in a dream or not - so I guess he is likely to be in the real world, and the wedding ring therefore might be a true clue to that.\nSo to answer the original question, if this is not the real world, what level is this?  Well if the top level of the story is not the real world, and is in fact another dream, then 'who knows' is the only real answer.

During film's golden age, most movie workers\nwere under contract to a studio, so the suits could credit their\ndrones--or not--as they saw fit. Today, people hire themselves out\nfilm by film, giving them and their unions more power.\n\"The presence of many credits today are adjudicated by unions and\nguilds,\" says Penn State senior film lecturer Kevin J. Hagopian. \"So,\nSteven Spielberg, even as a producer, could not decide simply to leave\noff these names.\"\n...One other factor: cheaper movies.

(What, you expected these\npeople to have a real sense of humor?) Instead of paying cash,\nindie-film producers often offer key spaces in their credits as a\nthank-you.\n\"When freelancing replaced the studio contract system, studios and\nproducers realized they could pay people less if they gave them\ncredit,\" San Francisco State University film professor Joseph McBride\nsays. \"So, the proliferation of credits went bananas in the '70s and\n'80s, to the point that now even the honey-wagon driver is credited.\"\n\nSo there does appear to be legalities involved in having people gain credits.

Some acknowledgments of financial\nsupport, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by\nthe granting institution.\n\nSo it appears many people, from actors through to cameramen, can use the fact they are included in credits as a form of \"proof\" on their CV so to speak, to absolutely guarantee they were involved in a project in that particular role.\nAn example of this on a minor stage, is the IMDB Credit System, which explicitly states that anyone can add their name as an actor to a film, but their system will check it against the official \"credits\" and remove it if not featured.\nPublic interest\nWhilst I imagine the majority of film watchers do not watch the end credits, there are a some who do (call them Dawsons) and are genuinely interested in how a particular part of a film was achieved (e.g. how a sound effect was completed or who was in charge of animal safety, etc).\nEdit:\nTo add in some of the fantastic points made in the comments:\nTom: People want acknowledgement for their hard work with a place in the credits, regardless of whether the audience will watch it.\nDamon: The credits add to the length of the movie which increases the amount of money it can be licensed to broadcasters for.\nClaudio Miklos: The credits are a piece of film history, recording for all time exactly who did what with a film.\n"}, {"question": "Why the greenish tint in the Matrix trilogy?", "answer": "\nThe green tint is suggestive of the early monochrome cathode monitors, a piece of imagery associated with early computing:\n \nThe Wachowski's wanted to create a mood palette, so they could cross cut between the Matrix and the Real world and an audience could immediately identify where the action was occuring through the use of such a colour scheme.\n"}, {"question": "What significance does Mike Yanagita have in Fargo?", "answer": "\nThe \"Mike Yaganita\" subplot is discussed on the Subplot Screenwriting Tips page, and a blog commenter writes: (Source: Kathleen A.

Leonard gets badly injured on the head during the burglary/rape (in his house), which causes his condition. This is actually important, because the last thing he remembers is this aggression (he says so himself), so it follows logically (to him) that his wife was killed during that night. (When actually his wife died only some times later and for another reason.)\nIf his condition didn't originate from that night, he would have formed more memories with his wife after that, and so he would know that she wasn't killed during that night. Which is not the case, so his condition definitely started that night.\nAfter that we can guess that the story he tells about Jankis' wife is actually his own story (somewhat distorted), since the policeman tells him that Jankis was actually a fraud that Leonard managed to uncover. So if the story Leonard tells about Jankis does not really apply to Jankis, we can suppose it actually applies to Leonard (at least partially).\nSo I think that for some reason his (Leonard's) wife had doubts about his condition (feared he was faking it) and decided to put him to the test, by repeatedly asking him to give her her insulin shot, which caused her death.\nAnd now comes the most interesting (and frightening) part: confronted with the fact that he killed his own wife, Leonard can't accept it and erases the part of the report that explains what happened. And he sets up some random clues that will lead him on a false track for a wrong reason (vengeance), knowing that he will soon forget that those false clues were planted by himself. And also knowing that his last memory (of his wife) will corroborate the idea that she was murdered that night, which will validate his quest for vengeance.\nSo he deliberately (and successfully) manipulates himself (and kills some innocent drug dealer who was set up by Teddy to make money in the process), simply because he knows that a normal life is no longer possible for him (due to his condition as well as the death of his wife) and that he needs a simple goal (vengeance) to keep going forward, day after day.\n(We can only speculate that once he killed the cop, he will repeat the process with some other random clues, in order to give his life some meaning again. ;) )\n"}, {"question": "Do Sheldon's equations reflect real math/physics research?", "answer": "\nAs a mere viewer of The Big Bang Theory, I can't answer this question with certainty, but as a physicist, I can offer a couple observations:\n\nThe equations that appear on the whiteboards in TBBT are from widely varied fields of physics and chemistry. They cover a much wider scope than a typical scientist would actually be working on. Of course, Sheldon is not your typical scientist, and I suppose he could be doing some sort of highly cross-disciplinary research incorporating many different subfields of physics, but still, all the various equations don't seem to have much of a logical connection. Anyway, given that Sheldon considers pretty much anything other than string theory to be beneath him, I can't really see him getting involved in that kind of project on a regular basis.\nMany of the equations I recognize as well-established physics, the kind of thing one learns as a beginning graduate student. This doesn't necessarily mean anything by itself, because all research is based on well-established physics, but if the equations on the boards were meant to reflect actual current research projects, I would expect to be going \"huh, what's that?\" and looking things up a lot more often than I do. The BBT blog discusses some reasons why it's generally not practical to incorporate actual current research into the show.\nThere's one particular scene that may be relevant to this: Leslie is over at the guys' apartment (sleeping with Leonard I think), and overnight she fixes an error in Sheldon's math on the whiteboard which he had been struggling with for some time. The thing is, the particular calculation Sheldon was doing (deriving the QCD beta function from renormalization of gluon-exchange diagrams, IIRC) is something that was first worked out back in the 1970s and has been standard physics ever since. It should have been utterly trivial for Sheldon, as an accomplished string theorist (and genius) to do this properly, so I just have  hard time believing that he'd been struggling with it. Even if he were, it would not have been hard for him to just look up the proper method and locate the error that way (perhaps his pride prevented him from doing that, but then again a big part of becoming a successful physicist is being able to look things up).\n\nSo in summary, I'd say almost certainly no, the equations do not in general reflect current progress in research (though the latest couple blog entries on the show's blog suggest that they're trying this). But they are at a much higher level than most other instances of math in movies and TV, and they are actual scientific equations, so you have to give the show credit for that.\n"}, {"question": "Why are the American flags backwards on the warden's uniform in Orange is the New Black?", "answer": "\nIt's traditional (but not required except in the military) for the US flag to be represented as flowing backwards as the person moves forwards.\n\nThink of the flag, not as a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole. As the Soldier moves forward, the red and white stripes will flow to the back.\n\nThis article explains it better than I can.\n\nCivilians often wonder why the US Army Flag Patch is reversed. The answer is: not all Army Flag Patches are reversed, but only those worn on the right shoulder. The reason has to do with proper display of the flag.\nThe blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a \"moving object\" like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front.\nIn application, then, flags are displayed on moving vehicles with the blue-star field always displayed towards the front of the vehicle. In this way, the flag appears to be blowing in the wind as the vehicle travels forward (flags are always attached to their flag poles on the blue field side). If the flag were not reversed on the right hand side of the vehicle, the vehicle might appear to be moving backwards (or \"retreating\").\nThe next time you visit an airport, notice that the US-flagged aircraft also have a \"reverse\" flag painted on the right side of the aircraft.\nFor flag patches worn on uniforms, the same principle applies: the blue star field always faces towards the front, with the red and white stripes behind.\nThink of the flag, not as a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole.

The room could have been perfectly ordinary. Meanwhile, the wall to the right, which Alice got thrown against, did not actually join the ceiling: if you take a close look at a still frame, you'll notice that there is no white border between it and the ceiling, like the other walls have, and the left side, where it seems to join the far wall, even is curved, probably to accommodate the pictures. And I didn't see any moment when Alice's shadow passed from this wall to the ceiling.\nTo sum up: Alice is dragged towards the camera, probably on a cart, and ends up next to a small, say half a metre high, fake wall. Clever lighting masks the gaps.\n\nUPD: I went back a little and noticed that the original wall was also sloped, so this is not an argument in favour of a separate wall per se. Nevertheless, while I don't have definite proof, such approach would definitely be much cheaper than building a full Ames room for a few seconds of screen time. \n"}, {"question": "First movie with product placement?", "answer": "\nIn the documentary \"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold\" (a film specifically about the topic of product placement), director Morgan Spurlock notes that one of the first recognized product placements was in the 1919 Roscoe Arbuckle comedy The Garage, in which a Red Crown Gasoline logo was displayed on screen.\nI expect watching the documentary would more than likely provide insight into product placement's rise in popularity in tv and film.\nSource: Product Placement on Movie Screens\n"}, {"question": "How do actors memorize extremely long scripts?", "answer": "\nUnless they're performing in a play, actors don't generally memorize the entire script before the film starts shooting.\nThe reality is, the film will take (on average) 6-12 weeks (or more) to film and the script will likely change constantly. While it's certainly good for an actor to be very familiar with the script so they know what's going to happen, the reality is, many actors memorize a few days' worth of script and work on it in rehearsals or in their private time... and some show up to set without it memorized at all... or reviewed... don't ask me how they survive. I think it's magic or something.\nWhen you only need to do 1-3 pages worth of script in a day, you have plenty of time to memorize.\nIn general, actors do have good memories... and part of their training is honing this ability... but good actors know the gist of what they're saying and the words should be natural to them, not \"learned by rote\". Many directors want natural performances and give actors some leeway to work inside the script a bit so that it feels natural to their character.\nMemory is one of those things that gets better as you use it... if you practice memorizing things, you will get better at it.

In the 1970s\n  these included: \"spectacular\" (The Wall Street Journal),\n  \"super-grosser\" (New York Times), and \"super-blockbuster\" (Variety).\n  In 1975 the usage of \"blockbuster\" for films coalesced around Steven\n  Spielberg's Jaws and became perceived as something new: a cultural\n  phenomenon, a fast-paced exciting entertainment, almost a genre.\n  Audiences interacted with such films, talked about them afterwards,\n  and went back to see them again just for the thrill.\n\nThe gist is that people would, \"Line up around the block,\" to see these films, when theaters were much smaller and had only a few screens, unlike today's multiplexes. So they quite literally \"busted the block\" as a single city block couldn't fully contain the line. Borrowing from its wartime connotation, the line of people could almost be said to have destroyed the block, as they could almost certainly bring foot traffic to a halt.\n \n\n\n\n"}, {"question": "Is it true that none of the cast knew what to expect in the famous \u201cchestburster scene\u201d in Alien?", "answer": "\nIt does appear to be true.

Then they said, \"Let's start again.\" We\n  all start leaning forward again and all of a sudden it comes out. I\n  tell you, none of us expected it. It came out and twisted round.\n\nAnd Ridley Scott got the reactions he wanted:\n\nWeaver: All I could think of was John, frankly. I wasn't even thinking\n  that we were making a movie.\nIvor Powell (associate producer): I hadn't expected it to be quite\n  that intense.\nWeaver: Look, I worked with Roman Polanski on Death and the Maiden -\n  he would shoot a gun off.

It was real, man. We didn't see that coming. We were\n  freaked. The actors were all frightened. And Veronica nutted out.\n\n\nA well-researched 2020 article offers some more details about how the scene was filmed:\n\nFour cameras were ready to roll for optimum footage. Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) could see the screenwriters huddled in the corner, gleefully awaiting the mayhem to come.\nA thin cut was made in the cavity T-shirt so that it would rip easily when the puppeteer below thrust the creature upwards. At first it didn\u2019t come through, so when they tried again the actors were already leaning in, and the amount of blood that burst forth really shocked them. Veronica Cartwright got a face full and actually flipped right over in surprise on the now slippy floor. She realised the cameras were still rolling and had to scramble back in shot.\nTo have the creature then shoot off across the table, a slit was cut through it, and someone yanked the puppeteer, who was lying on a small camera dolly. The tail whipping back and forth was achieved by inserting a thin tube through it and pumping it with compressed air. It is telling that there are no outtakes of actors or crew bursting into laughter. The atmosphere was highly charged: nothing like this had ever been seen before.\n\n"}, {"question": "In what spot would the new Star Wars movie \u201cRogue One\u201d go in the Machete Order?", "answer": "\nRod Hilton, the originator of Machete Order, answered this very question in his follow-up post to Machete Order.

That's all the motivation we get). Batman Begins was very much an origin story, showing also the training Bruce took to become Batman. The Dark Knight follows soon after that story, as the ending of Batman Begins sets up The Joker to enter the story.\nThe thing is, I tried looking up the reason, and I can't yet find any quotes online from Christopher Nolan (see this article here for an expanded story on this). The next film, The Dark Knight Rises, supposedly takes place 8 years after The Dark Knight. It also features Bane, a character who became notorious for eventually breaking Batman's back.

Even Ra's' origins were given flashbacks, although brief and nondescript.\nThe only facts to his backgrounds are that he started in Gotham, pitting low-level criminals against each other in elaborate robbery schemes where he comes out on top, with money.\nAs a point of reference, the opening scene of The Dark Knight shows his most recent attempt, with a lack of surprise from Gordon on the situation of criminals killing each other during a heist.\nBut this is only the past year (time between the end of Batman Begins and the beginning of The Dark Knight) and the rest of his timeline is what we see in the movie.\nFor clarification and emphasis of the answer:\nThere is no true origin of the Joker in any media.\n\nAs far as the comics, the same is true:\nThere are a multitude of origins of the Joker told from being a washed up comedian that went nuts, to just being that way from the start.\n\nThough many have been related, a definitive history of the Joker has never been established in the comics, and his true name has never been confirmed.\nNo recounting of the Joker's origin has been definitive, however, as he has been portrayed as lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened. As he says in The Killing Joke: \"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\"\n\nsource\nThe one true constant of any depiction of the Joker is that he wants to assert to Batman that all it takes is One bad day to send anyone into the insanity that he lives everyday.\nThe most prominent of this is during the short story The Killing Joke where he tortures Gordon almost to this point.\nAnd this is also what makes the Joker such the notorious villain that he is.

There were his fine new friends, who\n  would help him in his revenge!\n\u2014The Fellowship of the Ring: The Lord of the Rings, Part 1, Chapter II,\n   \"The Shadow of the Past\"\n\nWe know all this because Aragorn captured Gollum, at the request of Gandalf (Gandalf asks this of Aragorn shortly after Bilbo's birthday feast) and Gollum confessed to all of this, and Gandalf, with his divine knowledge, did a lot of deduction.\nBy the time Gollum was released and he resumed his pursuit, the ring had already left The Shire in the hands of Frodo, who was being escorted as a member of The Fellowship. That's why, in the movies, we meet Gollum tailing the fellowship in Moria, which prompts the following scene and dialogue:\n\n\n\n                FRODO\n          (whispers)\n      There's something down there.\n\n                GANDALF\n          (quietly)\n      It's Gollum.\n\n                FRODO\n      Gollum!\n\n                GANDALF\n      He's been following us for three days.\n\n  TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature.\n\n                FRODO\n          (disbelieving)\n      He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?\n\n                GANDALF\n      Escaped...or was set loose. And now the\n      Ring has drawn him here...he will never\n      be rid of his need for it. He hates and\n      loves the ring, as he hates and loves\n      himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story.\n\n\nA book answer is necessary to answer this question because the movie insufficiently explains Gollum's actions between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with a single line in the chapter of the movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) of the same name (\"Shadow of the Past\").\n                FRODO\n          (thinking fast)\n      We put it away, we keep it hidden! We\n      never speak of it again. No one know\n      it's here, do they?\n\nGandalf shifts uncomfortably.\n\n                FRODO (CONT'D)\n      Do they, Gandalf?\n\nGandalf looks at Frodo, sadly...\n\n\n                 GANDALF\n      There is one other who knew that Bilbo\n      had the Ring. I looked everywhere for\n      the creature Gollum, but the enemy found\n      him first.\n\nThis line serves as enough exposition to let us, the audience, know about their immediate danger, that Gandalf went looking for Gollum but that the enemy found him first, which is good enough information for the story being told in the movie, but not enough to explain in detail what happened to Gollum between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - we need the books to fill that gap. Since the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, from the characters down to the dialogue, is a pretty faithful adaptation of the books, it makes sense to use the book as a reliable source of further information that the movies don't provide.\n"}, {"question": "How is color determined when colorizing black and white movies?", "answer": "\nThey don't know. They don't care.\nIt doesn't matter what were the original colors. As the movie was filmed in black and white, the set, the costumes, even the makeup was designed to look good in black and white and not to have correct color.\nA famous example is the sets of the Addams Family which were built in pink, but the filming rendered them in grim colors. The emulsion of early films (about 1920s and earlier) was almost completely insensitive to red (reds were rendered as blacks) but on the other hand, it was overly sensitive to UV. One can say that the movies were filmed in ultraviolet, so not only the colors were \"lost\", but even the luminance we see on the film is absolutely nothing like the actors and set looked like to a naked eye. Here's an excellent article about peculiarities of early-film makeup, (credit to user151841 and 1006a for finding it) which explains how the actors were painted in colors resembling zombies in order to get a lively look on the film. So when/if black-and-white movies are colorized, it's counterproductive to restore the way they really looked. The new color has to reflect the way their creators wanted them to look, and there usually is no way to know that but guess.\nColoring process is not about \"conversion\" at all. It's an artistic process in which color is added by coloring artist as they see fit and to match to their taste.\n"}, {"question": "How was Looney Tunes originally watched?", "answer": "\nThey were shown in cinemas before a main feature, just as Pixar films have a short beforehand today.\nTypically a cinema would show a film, some cartoons, and some newsreel on a constant loop.

Disney was fairly notorious for this when I was a projectionist (from 2007 to 2011). They would include a \"guide card\" for things like bulb brightness and suggested volume level for many of their movies, especially animated features. They would even send in secret viewers to rate our presentation and provide us with feedback, and would send us little gifts if we had \"perfect presentation\".\nOtherwise if people complained a movie is too loud or not loud enough, if they informed someone on the ground they could let projection know, and we'd take it up or down a couple notches.\nHowever, loud can also be a fairly generic thing to describe. Movies can naturally be louder or quieter than others, either in full or from one moment to another, and that's all depending on how the sound was mixed and applied to the film. Used to be a notorious issue in the US with commercials being dramatically louder than the TV shows they were advertising on, that the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (or CALM Act) was passed. However, as with most regulation, there are ways around it.\nNaturally, audio is also a relative experience: what may be too loud for one person could be too quiet for another. For people who are hard of hearing, many theaters offer special headphones that offer an amplified audio feed for them so they can hear a louder version of the audio without making things too loud for others. There's even options for people who are completely deaf to provide closed captioning of dialog, or for blind patrons to offer descriptive audio to help explain what's happening on screen. Not every theater has these services, though.\n"}, {"question": "Why are so many American (spy) movies set in Europe?", "answer": "\nFirst of all, many of the actual activities involving espionage happened, originally, against the backdrop of the Cold War.  Obviously, having more different nations in a more compressed space gives a lot more chances for interactions.\nIf we take a U.S. spy, Jason Bourne, and send him on a mission, we must, by definition, deploy him to take actions against foreign agents and foreign governments.  The genre can be described as \"international espionage,\" so we need OTHER countries.... so, Europe.  Middle East is also popular.\nHowever, I do think this is your own Euro-centric viewpoint. A huge portion of the Jason Bourne films splits time between him tracking down his past in Europe, but also coming back to the USA, to infiltrate the CIA and its training facilities.\nHere are some spy or international terrorism-based movie themes that pit US intelligence services against \"bad guys\" that are almost entirely based in the USA (most of these are actually pretty good, too):\n\nThe Falcon and the Snowman (based on a true story)\nThree Days of the Condor\nThe Devil's Own\nBlown Away\nThe Siege\nBreach (true story)\nEnemy of the State\nNighthawk\nMercury Rising\nThe Conversation\nThe Osterman Weekend\nThe Parallax View\nSneakers\nNo Way Out\nClear and Present Danger\nSum of All Fears\n\n(I'm not sure about the ratio of USA domestic to foreign in those last two, but I think they're set mostly in the USA)\nMany movies in the US backdrop focus more on law enforcement and FBI because our spy agencies are prohibited by law from performing espionage against domestic targets, so you get more of a law enforcement angle, like in the movie Betrayed about an FBI agent infiltrating a domestic terrorist organization.\n"}, {"question": "Do I need knowledge of American culture and history to enjoy Forrest Gump?", "answer": "\nForrest Gump as a person has quite the strong development in character, but that is not the main strength of the movie.

He doesn't say - \"of course not, you wouldn't feel anything down here, must be Yusuf's driving\".  Then there is the Edith Piaf song used to synchronize the kick.  That is played by Yusuf into Arthur's ears in Level 1, yet is heard (faintly) in Level 3.  Then there is the 'second kick' that they experience when the van hits the water, this is felt in Level 3 - showing that something should be felt of the free-fall even at that layer.\nIf senses are attenuated with each layer it would be more realistic to think that somewhat less than free-fall would be experienced in Level 2, and some effect would be experienced in Level 3.  There is too much discrepancy between the total free-fall experienced by Arthur, and the apparent normality of skiing down a mountain that the team experience in Level 3.\nStill doesn't spoil my enjoyment of it though.\n"}, {"question": "Why is Discovery One covered in sulphur in \u201c2010: The Year We Make Contact\u201d?", "answer": "\nTL;DR:  Because the space around Io is full of large amounts of ionized sulfur produced by Io's many volcanoes.\nThere are an absurd number of volcanoes on Io, and they spew out an enormous amount of sulfur.  The low gravity and thin atmosphere allows the ejecta to escape Io's atmosphere and reach space.  As a result, Io's orbital path is like a donut-shaped cloud of sulfur dust (called a torus).  Jupiter's super-powered magnetosphere pulls up more sulfur from Io's atmosphere itself, and ionizes all of this sulfur, making it stick to any neutrally charged surfaces in the vicinity.  \n\n\n\nIo's surface is riddled with volcanoes; the large red circle in the southern hemisphere is a ring of sulfur surrounding the volcano Pele (more images of Pele below) \n\n\nIo, Volcanoes, and Sulfur:\nThe sulfur comes primarily from Io itself - specifically, the enormous number of active volcanoes (at least 400, at last count) that dot the surface of the moon.  The abundance of volcanic activity on Io is primarily the result of the tremendous tidal forces caused by Jupiter's immense gravitational pull. \n\nA small sample of some of Io's known volcanoes\n\nSeveral volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the surface. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io's silicate crust... Most of Io's surface is composed of extensive plains coated with sulfur and sulfur-dioxide frost.\n\nJupiter's moon Io, as photographed by the Galileo probe.  The varying colors are mostly different kinds of sulfur (photo's colors altered to better represent what Io would actually look like to the human eye).\nIo's volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur.\n  -  Wikipedia\n\n\nOne of Io's best known volcanoes, Pele, and the ring of sulfur it has produced (for a picture of a massive plume of ejecta coming from one of Pele's eruptions, see below) \nNot only is the surface of the moon covered in volcanic sulfur dust, the atmosphere is full of sulfur spewed out by volcanic activity as well:\n\nWhen the twin probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 passed by Io in 1979, their more advanced imaging system allowed for far more detailed images. Voyager 1 flew past Io on 5 March 1979 from a distance of 20,600 km (12,800 mi).\nShortly after the encounter, Voyager navigation engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a plume emanating from the surface in one of the images.  Analysis of other Voyager 1 images showed nine such plumes scattered across the surface, proving that Io was volcanically active.  This conclusion was predicted in a paper published shortly before the Voyager 1 encounter by Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds. The authors calculated that Io's interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede (see the \"Tidal heating\" section for a more detailed explanation of the process).  Data from this flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frosts. These compounds also dominate its thin atmosphere...\n  -  Wikipedia\n\nThe escape velocity (the speed necessary for an object to leave an astronomical object) of Io is relatively low1, because its gravity is only 1/6 that of Earth's, and the atmosphere is very thin (Earth's atmosphere is roughly 200,000,000 times denser than Io's).  Taken together, these facts mean that when a volcano on Io erupts, the plume of ejecta can easily escape the atmosphere and enter space.  By way of comparison, if we somehow moved the famous \"Old Faithful\" geyser from Yellowstone National Park to the surface of Io, it's plumes of water would reach heights of ~37 kilometers (23 miles) - compared with its actual height of 106-185 feet (32-56 meters) here on Earth.\nEnormous volcanic plumes on Io, leaving the atmosphere and spraying out into space (the third image shows an eruption from the volcano Pele2, the subject of another photo posted above):\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcanic plume on Io rising 330 km (210 mi) above the surace of the moon\n\nIo, Jupiter, Magnetospheres, and Flux Tubes:\nIn real life, there is something known as a \"flux tube\" between Jupiter and Io.\n\nA flux tube is a generally tube-like (cylindrical) region of space containing a magnetic field, such that the field at the side surfaces is parallel to those surfaces. Both the cross-sectional area of the tube and the field contained may vary along the length of the tube, but the magnetic flux is always constant...\nAs used in astrophysics, a flux tube generally has a larger magnetic field and other properties that differ from the surrounding space. They are commonly found around stars, including the Sun, which has many flux tubes of around 300 km diameter. Sunspots are also associated with larger flux tubes of 2500 km diameter. Some planets also have flux tubes. A well-known example is the flux tube between Jupiter and its moon Io.\n  -  Wikipedia\n\nThis particular flux tube contains a significant amount of ionized sulfur:\n\nAn electric current of five million amperes flows along Io\u2019s flux tube. It connects Io to the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, like a giant umbilical cord. The plasma torus is centered near Io\u2019s orbit, and it is about as thick as Jupiter is wide. The torus is filled with energetic sulfur and oxygen ions that have a temperature of about 100 thousand kelvin. \n\nSource:  Seven Wonders of the Gas Giants and Their Moons By Ron Miller\nJupiter's magnetic field - or magnetosphere - is obscenely powerful:\n\nThe stronger the magnetic field, the larger the magnetosphere. Some 20,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, Jupiter's magnetic field creates a magnetosphere so large it begins to avert the solar wind almost 3 million kilometers before it reaches Jupiter. The magnetosphere extends so far past Jupiter it sweeps the solar wind as far as the orbit of Saturn.\n  -  University of Colorado at Boulder:  Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics\n\n\nSchematic of Jupiter's magnetosphere and the components influenced by Io (near the center of the image): the plasma torus (in red), the neutral cloud (in yellow), the flux tube (in green), and magnetic field lines (in blue).\nThis overpowered magnetosphere sucks up gas and dust from Io's atmosphere at an absurd rate of ~1 tonne per second.  The material - predominantly oxygen and sulfur - is ionized by the enormous amounts of electrical energy (400,000 volts, 3 million amperes, and about 2,000,000,000,000 watts - roughly equivalent to all the electricity produced by humans) thrown off by Jupiter.  \nSome of the ionized sulfur is actually caught in Jupiter's magnetic field and drawn back to the gas giant, where it strikes the gases at Jupiter's poles and causes aurorae:\n\n\nIonized Sulfur and Discovery One:\nWhen the film begins, a mission is being arranged to reach the Discovery One, which ran into trouble in 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Time is of the essence, because the derelict spacecraft is adrift and will soon crash into one of Jupiter's moons - namely, Io. NASA is clearly interested in finding out what happened to Discovery One and her crew, and because the ship is about to be smashed to pieces, they have to get there in a hurry.\nThe fact that the ship is going to crash into Io implies that it is probably in an unstable orbit around Io.  This would mean that the Discovery One has been floating around in the flux tube for several years, surrounded by the massive clouds of ionized sulfur.  \nIt wouldn't even need to be this close, though - studies of one of Jupiter's other moons, Europa (also an important plot element in the movie), have found that there are chemical reactions taking place on Europa's icy surface.  These reactions involve large amounts of ionized sulfur and oxygen, and it is thought that the sulfur and oxygen on Europa were originally spewed out by Io's volcanoes.\nThe ship would be likely to accumulate a coating of sulfur dust from being relatively close to Io, regardless of other factors.  However, our own real world spacecraft - for example, the International Space Station - are designed in such a way that the hull is essentially \"grounded\" to prevent massive problems from electrical charge buildup.  \n\nThe grounding of the space station's photovoltaic arrays (the negative end of the arrays are grounded to the structure) place the ISS at large negative electrical potentials (-160 volts DC) relative to the ambient space plasma when the arrays are producing power.\nIn order to avoid sputtering and to lessen other undesired results of this grounding scheme, plasma contactor devices in the hull emit a steady stream of plasma from the station to raise its potential to within a few volts of the ambient plasma.\nThe plasma contactor acts as an electrical ground rod to connect the space station structure to the local environment and harmlessly dissipate the structure charges. GRC engineers designed, manufactured, and tested the hollow cathode assembly, which performs this function by converting a small supply of gas into ions and electrons and discharging this stream to space. The stream carries with it the excess electrons that created the surface charge.\n  -  NASA\n\nWe might assume that the Discovery One employs some form of hull grounding as well. \nIf so, then the ship would become a veritable magnet, actively pulling the ionized sulfur to its hull, much like an electrostatic paint spraying system.\n\nAn electrostatic paint spray system is a highly efficient technology for the application of paint to specific workpieces. Negatively charged atomized paint particles and a grounded workpiece create an electrostatic field that draws the paint particle to the workpiece...\nBecause the charged particles are attracted to the grounded workpiece, overspray is significantly reduced. Paint particles that pass a workpiece can be attracted to and deposited on the back of the piece. This phenomena is known as \"wrap\".\n  -  Source\n\n\n\"Would this (likely) happen to a ship orbiting Io at a comparable altitude for a similar amount of time, out-of-universe?\"\nProbably.  The only spacecraft that have been through the flux tube and torus where the sulfur is most abundant are long-distance, one-way probes like the Voyager and Galileo probes.  We obviously can't see them to check the hull's color, but Voyager 1 ran into some problems in the flux tube:\n\nAs noted by Scudder et al. [1981], within the Io plasma torus where electron densities ne exceeded 1000 cm -3, the spacecraft charged to a negative potential. When the spacecraft becomes negatively charged, the return current relation used by Scudder et al. [1981] is no longer valid, and some other other means must be used to estimate ne and the spacecraft potential \u03a6sc.\n  -  University of Colorado at Boulder: Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics\n\nConsidering the fact that the probe became so negatively charged that the instruments no longer function properly, and when the negative charge was acquired by flying through ionized sulfur, chances are the probe picked up a coating of sulfur - and that's just from passing through the area for a few hours, not lingering there for years.\n\nConclusion:\nWhen a spacecraft spends nine years floating around in a cloud of ionized volcanic sulfur, it's going to end up covered in yellow, foul-smelling dust. \nAnd this:\n\nBecomes this:\n\n\n\n1Earth's escape velocity is ~11 kilometers per second; Io's is ~2.5 kilometers per second\n2The largest plumes produced by Io's volcanoes are called \"Pele-type plumes\" because Pele's eruptions are so enormous.  Pele-type plumes can reach heights of 300-500 km (190-310 mi).  A plume 500 km high is about 1/7th the diameter of the entire moon;  by way of comparison, if Earth's volcanoes produced plumes with a height equal to 1/7th of its diameter, the plumes would be 1,820 km (1,130 mi) high. The ring of sulfur around Pele is 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) wide - about 1/3 the diameter of the moon;  this would be like a ring of sulfur 4,247 km (2,638 mi) wide on earth - about the size of the United States. \n"}, {"question": "Do they really crash super cars in action movies?", "answer": "\nIt's very broad to say yes or no.

Well, as you will read below, this isn't actually specified like this, but since the source speaks of the \"brain becoming a  wireless connection\", it seems the safest thing to assume.\nIn any case, no magic is involved.\nIn the IMDB FAQ page for Matrix Revolutions, we see the question: What explanation does the movie give for Neo now having his powers in the real world?\nAnd the answer is (emphasis mine).\n\nThe machines in the real world are all connected to a \"singular consciousness\", the birth of Artificial Intelligence described by Morpheus in the first Matrix film. This consciousness is otherwise known as \"The Source\". The machine connection is a remote one or some sort of wireless signal. Having touched The Source (i.e. meeting with the Architect) and having the data needed to reboot the Matrix, Neo is, at this point, simultaneously in possession of his human brain but also connected to the singular consciousness. In other words, his is also now a wireless connection. Hence the reason Neo says, \"Something's different. I can feel them.\" The machines are all separate entities but all connected to this one Source.\nNow, Neo is connected as well. He is thereby able to harness this power and stop the Sentinels. However, Neo wasn't ready to handle the signal surge at the end of Reloaded and collapsed in a comatose state, no longer in control of just where this wireless signal would be directed. The signal (Neo's residual self-image) is then captured and held in a program limbo derived from the Source but undetected as an existing realm, so to speak.\nThis limbo (the \"Mobil Ave\" train station) was created by the Trainman (Bruce Spence), a program in service to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). This connection forged by Neo's visit to the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis) and his subsequent decision to return to the real world made him, unknowingly, unique.

Drogon would have been an equally valid target.\nBut there are some options here as to why the NK chose Viserion over Drogon.\n1. Drogon is considerably larger.\nAlthough the ice spear did penetrate Viserion's skin with relative ease, Drogon is a considerably larger and stronger dragon. \nWe don't know much about the ice spear and whether it has any magical qualities that help with killing dragons. But given that Qyburn's ballista would make for an effective weapon too, I'm going to assume that dragon scales can be penetrated by brute force alone, without any magic. The ice spear was thrown with a tremendous amount of force.\nBut maybe killing Drogon was a stretch. He's a bigger dragon, and looks to be more armored as well. Maybe the Night King wasn't sure that it'd kill Drogon, and therefore he focused on the smaller, weaker dragons first.\n2. Drogon was on the ground.\nViserion was hit, couldn't fly anymore, and hit the ice with a considerable impact. When Dany flies away later, you can see that the mark Viserion left on the ice is by far the largest, thus showing that Viserion made a high velocity, high impact landing.\nDrogon was on the ground. Even if he were to be hit in the same fashion as Viserion, he wouldn't hit the ground with such an impact, thus not knocking him out or killing him on impact. This may give Drogon (or Danaerys) the time to deal with the spear.\nViserion did lose a lot of blood very quickly; but Drogon is comparatively larger and more armored, would bleed less, and is maybe able to shrug it off more easily (similar to why stabbing a dog-sized animal with a dagger will kill it, but stabbing an elephant-sized animal will only wound it)\nThere is another thing to consider here. The spear hit Viserion under the wing. I'm not sure how much of a marksman the Night King is, but he hit Viserion in a place that would prevent him from flying, which is exactly how he should have taken Viserion down. It's also likely that the dragons are less armored near their wings, because armoring would chafe them during flying. They need a fair range of movement with their wings.  \nThis is pure speculation, but if we assume that the Night King was aiming for a weak spot near the base of the wing, Drogon would not be a viable target as he was using his wings to rest on the ground, and therefore covering it. The weak spot would not be visible/hittable by the Night King.\nEven if he could pierce Drogon's wing to hit the weak spot anyway, he had no line of sight to the weak spot and would be guesstimating his throw. Since this theory assumes that the Night King was aiming precisely, that makes Drogon a difficult target to accurately hit (exactly on the weak spot).  \nComparatively, the flying dragons were better targets, as their weak spots are more exposed to those below them.\nLooking at the linked image in GhotiandChips' answer, from the Night King's perspective, most of what he could hit on Drogon seems to either be pretty well armored, or invisible due to the wing covering line of sight to it.\n3. Drogon couldn't escape right away.\nIt should have been clear to the Night King that Drogon was the transport dragon, carrying Dany and soon also the others. This slows Drogon down. He is also not able to just up and leave, because he can't leave Dany or the others, who will be quickly overwhelmed by the wights.\nThe Night King wasn't trying to kill one dragon, he was trying to kill multiple dragons. He obviously did not stop at killing one. Though we didn't see him throw a third spear, nor target Rhaegal specifically, it seems fair to assume that he was trying to kill all the dragons.\nIf he kills Drogon first, Rhaegal and Viserion can immediately fly away. They are already in the air, mobile, and they don't have to take people along with them.\nIf he kills a flying dragon first, Drogon can't just fly away. Not only will it take him more time to leave (due to not flying already), he also needs to load people, and presumably fly more safely so that the people do not fall off (evidenced by Jorah almost falling off when Drogon dodged the spear).\nIf you're trying to kill as much as you can, start by killing those who can run away to safety quickly, and kill the slow ones later.\n4. Unknown and out of universe reasons\n\nViserion was the weakest dragon, mentally and physically. Maybe that's why Viserion was targeted. Maybe dragons can resist the resurrection of the white walkers (or retain their identity), but Viserion is notably weak (as was Vyserys, who the dragon is named after). But this is pure speculation of course.\nIt's a story. It wouldn't make narrative sense to kill the representative dragon first. Drogon is shown considerably more often than the others, because he is the representative of the dragons. This is similar to Thormund. We haven't seen any wildlings (excuse me, Free Folk) lately. Whenever the wildl... Free Folk have been part of the story, they have been represented by Thormund. Other representatives are Grey Worm (for the Unsullied), Daario (for the Second Sons), Yohn Royce (for the knights of the Vale), Jaqen (for the Faceless Men, who really should be represented by many faces to prove a point), ...\nIt's classic exposition. When a villain introduces his doomsday weapon, he will usually showcase its ability on a random test subject. This is done to prove to the viewer that the weapon is real and deadly. I could point to another example from Rick and Morty. There is a scene where Rick is sad, but is not speaking (it's just music playing). He takes out a device, and a little creature, and kills the creature with the device. He then puts the device on his own head, clearly intending to kill himself. If the viewer did not see the first creature die, they would not understand that this is a suicide attempt (e.g. maybe it's a device to clear headaches). The same is true here. Viserion's death proves to the viewer that dragons can be killed by White Walkers. Up until now, that was never proven. It's possible that viewers thought that the dragons are the be all end all solution to White Walkers, but this scene proves that they are still risking their lives by fighting the White Walkers.\n\n"}, {"question": "Has there been a movie or a TV show where an abortion was portrayed without negative connotations?", "answer": "\nObvious Child\nA somewhat recent romantic comedy has actually been lauded for its treatment of this subject: Obvious Child from 2014 starring comedian Jenny Slate. From a Slate article:\n\nIn the new movie Obvious Child, twentysomething stand-up comic Donna gets pregnant after a drunken one-night stand, loses her job, attempts to schedule an abortion at her local Planned Parenthood clinic, and\u2014cherry on top\u2014discovers that the only available appointment is on Feb. 14. Turns out, it\u2019s the perfect day: This is a romantic comedy where the girl gets an abortion and gets the guy. Along the way, she doesn\u2019t even have a change of heart, contract a nasty infection, or succumb to a tragic death. That makes Obvious Child a run-of-the-mill story for a woman in America but an exceedingly rare tale for a woman on film.\n[...]\nObvious Child executes [a] remarkable feat. While other films that touch on abortion conspire to neutralize a woman's choice, or else punish her for it, Obvious Child never dwells on Donna\u2019s decision. (This is no \u201cDonna\u2019s Dilemma.\u201d) Instead, it plays with all the other choices inherent in the abortion decision\u2014like how much to involve the man in the choice, how to tell your mom, and how to talk about it all publicly\u2014and it does it all with humor and poignancy without getting glib.\n\nThe article details the contrasting, stark depiction of the subject in previous works and its causes, but also contains another somewhat positive portrayal: A plot from the sitcom Maude in 1972:\n\nUntil Obvious Child, the best, most honest portrayal of abortion on screen aired in 1972 (after the procedure was legalized in New York, but before Roe took it nationwide), when Maude featured a two-episode abortion plotline titled \u201cMaude\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d in which 47-year-old Maude becomes unexpectedly pregnant and spends a full television hour brashly debating every aspect of her choice with friends and family\u2014including her age, her financial situation, her temperament, her husband\u2019s feelings, and her daughter\u2019s concerns. She ultimately chooses abortion, but not before the show wrings all possible feminist statements and dark laughs from the predicament.\n\nOther notable (and recent) examples of this trope\u2019s subversion\n\nCristina\u2019s decision to have an abortion on Grey\u2019s Anatomy in season\u00a08. From the LA Times:\n\nCristina is not a teenager, or a rape or an incest victim. She is not poor with eight kids and an abusive husband or suffering from mental illness. She does not have a rare disease that makes pregnancy a physical risk. Unlike Maude, she isn't an \"older\" woman with mid-life concerns. Cristina is married, healthy, financially stable and of prime childbearing years. She chose to have an abortion because she did not want to have a child. [...] [She] did not seem particularly agonized. She seemed, as she said she was, scared and sad, but she knew that she did not want to have a baby.\n\nJane\u2019s mother\u2019s decision to have it on Jane the Virgin in season 3. From Vanity Fair:\n\nJane [the Virgin] handled the subject with a rare attitude: empathetic, but casual. Viewers don\u2019t really watch Xiomara grapple and agonize over the decision, or even see her go to the clinic. In the time gap between the season premiere and episode two, Xiomara has an abortion off-screen. Instead of focusing on the decision itself, the episode focuses on how her family reacts\u2014and ultimately overcomes their different perspectives. \n\n\n"}, {"question": "How is Team Scooby Doo (Mystery Inc.) funded?", "answer": "\nAccording to Scooby-Doo Behind the Scenes (released in 1998; see Wikiquote), the initial money to start out was given to them by Daphne\u2019s dad:\n\nDaphne: \"Well, Daddy gave us the money to start off.

Remember how everyone was surprised at Bilbo's apparently unaged looks compared to his actual age (and his pretty fast aging once he didn't have the ring anymore). And also remember his reluctance to give up the ring (into which he had to be seriously \"persuaded\" by Gandalf) and his \"outburst\" in Rivendell when he caught a glimpse of it on Frodo's neck (a scene that made me jump in my seat on the first view and that still terrifies me whenever I see it). Those effects might very well have worsened if Bilbo would have kept the ring for longer.\n\nBut another important aspect is, that Gollum is a morally weaker person to begin with. After all the ring for him was won in an act of evil in the first place, murdering his friend for the \"precious\". That is something we could surmise Bilbo wouldn't have done, as evident from the mercy he showed Gollum -- a supposedly disgusting creature he didn't even know -- when he had him at the point of his sword after stealing his ring. But he saw what a miserable creature Gollum was and felt compassion for him.\nThen add to this, that Gollum is also pretty much a product of his circumstances. When he killed his friend he became a social outcast, which even more contributed to his further moral degradation and his alienation from \"normal\" social life. His split personality might on the one hand be just a natural result of his loneliness but might on the other hand as well be a way to cope with his deeds, first and foremost the murder of his friend, either by said friend manifesting as the second personality or just as an attempt to blame his deeds on that \"other person\" living inside of him. And the fact that he became a cave-dweller far from the sunlight eating raw fish and orcs and whatever vile creatures might have contributed to his further physical deterioration. Bilbo on the other hand still lived a happy life as an accepted member of a blooming social environment so that the ring couldn't unfold its whole potential on him, but after all we also know that if the ring has anything, it's patience.\n"}, {"question": "Why do British sitcoms have much fewer episodes than American ones?", "answer": "\nFrom BBC America - Five Bizarre Things About British Television:\n\n\nThe Six Episode Season\n  Most British drama or comedy shows have a very short season. The classic amount for comedies is just six episodes per series \u2013 The Office being a prime example \u2013 and there\u2019s one very good reason for this. \nAmerican comedy is a producer\u2019s medium, in which an idea is worked up, characters developed and early scripts written, and then the show is handed over to a larger group of writers to flesh out into actual scripts. \nBritish comedy is a writer\u2019s medium. The scripts are almost always written and developed by one or two people, then taken to production. Graham Linehan, the writer of Father Ted and The IT Crowd, even directs his own scripts, which is a LOT of work. \n\n\nFrom TIME Magazine - What the U.S. Can Learn from British TV:\n\nThere are underlying economic reasons for the two different models. \nThe goal of almost any American commercial series is to air at least 100 episodes, because that\u2019s when it can be sold into syndication and aired as reruns on other stations or networks. That\u2019s where the real money is. \nBut the BBC is publicly financed, so not every show has to earn its investment back with a multiseason run.\n\nFrom TV Tropes - British Brevity:\n\nBritish shows usually have a fairly small creative team. \nIt's not uncommon for one person to single-handedly write every episode of a show, as Steven Moffat did with Coupling, or David Renwick with Jonathan Creek. \nThere's more pressure to succeed, and less of a chance to make a lasting impression or develop long plot arcs. Ruin two episodes and that's a third of a season down the tubes. Some American shows that start off weak can grow their beard when the show would have long been over in the UK.\nOn the other hand, British shows tend to have the entire series filmed before broadcast, so shows are rarely canceled mid-season, or affected by events like a writers' strike.\n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the US has 114 million TV households, whereas the UK has 26 million. Fewer viewers means there is less money to be made. And less money means fewer episodes.\n"}, {"question": "Do Star Trek characters wearing red shirts have the highest death rate on the original show?", "answer": "\nRed shirts have a skewed death rate in TOS due to the nature of their job. The Security role is handled by Ops, which all wear red shirts (Scotty, the engineer, is also Ops). So red shirts die in higher number because Security officers are at a higher risk. They assume guard duties and the dangers inherent to that role. \nIn TNG and beyond, the color structure has changed. Command has become the red shirts, and ops has become gold. In TNG, there is a higher number of gold shirt deaths. Tasha Yar being a prime example. Again,  it is because Security is gold. \n\nThat\u2019s according to Matthew Barsalou, who debunked the red shirt curse for Significance Magazine by mathematically breaking down the death rates, by uniform color, of characters on the original Star Trek. A simple pie chart reveals 55 total deaths and, yes, red shirts perished in frightening numbers. A whopping 24 died, compared to 9 in yellow/gold command and 7 in blue, with 15 crossing into the final frontier in unidentified colors. However, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective and percentages. There were 430 crewmen aboard the Enterprise, 239 of them in engineering, security or operations, and all wore red. So, in reality, they had a decent survival rate, and it was, statistically speaking \u2013 courtesy of a little something called Bayes\u2019 theorem -- the folks in gold who were more likely to meet their maker. - See more at: http://www.startrek.com/article/did-redshirts-really-die-more-often-on-tos#sthash.wUlkpts5.dpuf\n\nSo while red shirts in TOS are statistically safer, based on ship crew complement, they suffer a higher on screen death count.

They also vary from show to show, so for any one \"rule of thumb\" it's almost guaranteed you can find an exception on the air right now on some channel.\nThe basic guidelines that most shows follow most of the time are drawn from the rules for the various industry guilds. In the case of actors, that would be SAG (the WGA and DGA would determine how/when a writer or director get credited.) The Wikipedia articles linked in a few comments/answers gives a basic rundown of all the guild rules that have to be followed in the \"typical\" credits sequence. Note that movies opening and closing credit sequences differ a lot from television ones (in particular, you rarely see the name of the production company in a TV show's opening credits.) \nHowever, there's a lot of variation on the basic theme, because the placement and styling in the credits sequence is often part of an actor's individual contract with the studio. Studios will rearrange the credits or give certain actors special consideration in the credits as part of the negotiations. \nThe basic flow of credits is as you mentioned: core actors first, followed by guest actors, followed by a handful of top-level production staff. In TV, it's rare to have a full set of closing credits the way you have in movies, where the entire cast would appear with their character names, for simple time reasons: they would take a really long time that could instead be used for commercials. (In fact, many networks now show split-screen closing credits side by side with a promo for the upcoming program.) So those credits are usually limited to production-level people and companies, copyright/legal notices, and other minutia.\nWhy a particular actor gets a particular spot in the credits is mostly a matter of PR, and explains some of the variations you mention in your question:\n\nBeing billed before the title is \"more prestigious\" than after the title; usually only the one or two top-tier stars will get this billing, if at all. In ensemble shows it's rare to see this type of split billing.\nActors are generally billed in rough \"order of importance\" to the show.\nBeing billed last, however, is also considered a key position, as long as it is somehow differentiated from the rest of the cast. For example, in the Buffy TV show, Anthony Stewart Head (arguably the most \"famous\" cast member prior to the show) was billed as \"and Anthony Stewart Head as Giles\" - the only cast member whose character was named.\nSince the opening credits are pre-recorded, typically only season regulars make it into the \"core\" credits sequence (think \"theme music\") for shows that have them. Recurring guest stars are usually billed overtop of the opening scene, introduced with \"Also Starring\".\nSingle-episode guest stars go last; depending on how famous/important they are, they may also get the \"as charactername\" treatment.\n\nIn general, having a unique style of credit (e.g. being specifically associated with a character) is a bonus given out to special guest stars and particularly important actors that lets them stand out from the rest of the cast. This is something a well-known or highly-priced actor would negotiate as a condition of their appearance. They even negotiate down to the exact wording, which can include \"guest\" vs. \"special guest\", are they \"starring\" or \"appearing\", etc (I have seen shows that had multiple guest stars, each billed slightly differently).\nAnother key distinction to make is between series regulars and recurring guest stars. A series regular will still appear in the opening credits, and be given credit for the episode, even if they don't actually appear in the episode. \nThe general idea here is that a series regular, even if they aren't in a particular episode, is contractually required to be available to appear in that episode. A recurring guest actor, on the other hand, is typically contracted to appear in only a specific number of episodes, and can usually skip a particular episode if they have prior commitments. A recurring guest star, with lower billing, may actually get more screen time than a series regular that gets top billing. This happened in House in seasons 4-6, where Olivia Wilde, Kal Penn and Peter Jacobson were given lower \"Also Starring\" billing, while rarely-appearing Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer continued to be billed as series regulars. As always, this was entirely down to the contracts the latter two had with the show.\n"}, {"question": "Why was there a 14 year gap between The Incredibles and The Incredibles 2?", "answer": "\nFor writer-director Brad Bird, it all came down to story.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, many sequels are cash grabs,\u201d Bird told reporters during a recent press event to promote Incredibles 2. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in the business that I can\u2019t stand, where they go, \u2018if you don\u2019t make another one, you\u2019re leaving money on the table.\u2019 It\u2019s like, money on the table is not what makes me get up in the morning; making something that people are gonna enjoy a hundred years from now, that\u2019s what gets me up. So if it were a cash grab, we would not have taken fourteen years \u2013 it makes no financial sense to wait this long \u2013 it\u2019s purely that we had a story we wanted to tell.\u201d\nBird admitted that the proliferation of superhero properties in recent years has made it much harder to tell an original story; the first film debuted before Pixar\u2019s parent company, Disney, purchased Marvel, and predated Iron Man by four years - meaning that the new film is entering a very different cinematic landscape from its predecessor.\n\nThere's a fair bit more in the source article\nWhy Did Incredibles 2 Take So Long? Brad Bird Explains the Sequel's Delay\nSome of which also relates to multiple rewrites concerning the villain storyline and trying to make I2 more unique in an ever-proliferating cinema-scape of super-hero movies.\n"}, {"question": "Why was there a robot in Rocky IV?", "answer": "\nSome interesting info can be found here.  \nBasically, to summarize the article, Stallone discovered the company that produced the robot was using it as a tool to help autistic children.  One of Stallone's children is autistic, so he became enamored with the robot and offered to write a part for it in the next Rocky movie.  Apparently there was more scripted around building the relationship between Paulie and the robot, but it was scrapped. \n"}, {"question": "How far back do I need to watch Doctor Who for it to still make sense?", "answer": "\nThere are some great answers here already, but as a huge Whovian I wanted to add a little more information.\nAs a complete beginner to the series definitely start with the 2005 Doctor Who series. The series will make perfect sense and there will be nothing revealed that will leave you confused (or at least nothing that won't be cleared up later in the series!). \nThere are old enemies/allies from the original series that will appear and you'll not realise it - but that won't affect your viewing experience in the least.\nNow, if you watch the Series, like it and decide to consider watching the Original Series, consider the following:\nDoctor Who kicked off all the way back in 1963. This is significant for a few reasons. The original series was in black and white. Now, I'm a child of the nineties and as much as I'm ashamed to admit it, a lack of colour really does affect a movie for me. I'm so unused to things being black and white that I find it much deeper to embrace older movies/shows. Of course that's not universal and I've enjoyed some fantastic old films and tv shows - but without question they require far more concentration on my part to really get into. If you're anything like me and you think that a lack of colour (at least for the first few series) would bother you, it's worth bearing this point in mind.\nUnlike the original Star Trek, which was in colour and has since been touched up/remastered, the original Doctor Who episodes with William Hartnell do show their age. They're certainly watchable and enjoyable, but you'll need to concentrate and accept some very dark/grainy footage at times.\nYou'll also need to accept that as times changed, so did the character of the Doctor. Nowadays, we want a fun, energetic, brilliant, slightly sexy Doctor, which is where the likes of David Tennant (10th) and Matt Smith (11th) came from. Back then, the idea of the Doctor was that he would be a very intelligent, slightly dotty man. That's the character William Hartnell plays. An old, clever man, who is slightly mischievous. He by no means always saves the day. In fact, in many situations he's the one who gets them into trouble and his companions (Barbara and Ian, two teachers) are the saviours. \nI'm bringing all this up because if you watch the new series, the character that the Doctor portrays is not how it was in the original series (at least to begin with).\nAnother issue to consider is that in the very beginning Doctor Who had an educational remit. This meant that for every \"futuristic\" serial it ran, it had to run a serious \"historical\" serial which would accurately tell a real life historical event (such as Marco Polo, the burning of Rome by Nero etc). Now this remit only last a few series, but it's another thing that's worth bearing in mind.\nFinally, if you do decide to go back to the Original Series, there is one more thing you must accept. Due to the wiping policy of the BBC there are a number of episodes of Doctor Who that are missing (mostly Patrick Troughton, the 2nd Doctor's, but also a fair few of Hartnell's (1st Doctor)). \nIn other words, if you do start watching William Hartnell right from 1963, within a few years you'll start hitting episodes that you'll either have to listen to the audio from (they were broadcast over radio) or you'll have to skip entirely.\nHaving said all that, the big positive of going back to the Original Series is that you'll get to soak in all the Doctor Who mythology, hear, see, live and breath the universe presented and be a \"true\" Whovian! But - it is a long (and expensive) haul. Don't expect to finish anytime soon!\nConclusion \nUnquestionably start with the Modern Series (2005). If you like it and want more and are considering the Original Series, consider the following questions:\n\nWill the black and white/grainy aspect of the stories bother you?\nWill the low production costs of original episodes bother you?\nWill the different presentation of the Doctor (not as strong/intelligent etc) as modern Doctor bother you?\nWill the fact many of the 2nd Doctors serials are missing, meaning you'd have to \"skip\" them bother you?\n\nIf the answer to any of these is yes, then perhaps the Original Series isn't for you.\nIf the answer to all of these is no, then start watching and enjoying :)\n"}, {"question": "How did Indy know not to look into the Ark?", "answer": "\nThere was a deleted scene that explained it:\n\nA plot element involving the Ark of the Covenant was cut from the film and is only hinted at during the finale when the Ark is opened. \nBasically, there were 2 rules about the Ark not mentioned in the final cut of the film:\n\nIf you touch the Ark, you die \nIf you look at the Ark when it is opened, you die \n\nThis is first explained in additional dialogue for the scene when Indy and Sallah visit Imam. Before translating the writings on the headpiece that give the height of the Staff of Ra, Imam warns Indy not to touch the Ark or look at it when it is opened.\n [Source]\nThe next scene involving this Ark subplot is when Sallah and Indy remove the Ark from the Well of the Souls. When Sallah first sees it he reaches out to touch it. Indy stops him before he does and reminds him of Imam's warning. Then they insert long poles through each side of the Ark to lift it out of its crypt.\n [Source]\nNotice that nobody ever touches the Ark throughout the rest of the film until the finale.\n\nAnd from the Bible (King James Version):\n\n1 Samuel 6:19:\n   And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men...\n2 Samuel 6:6-7\nAnd when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

During copious test screenings, Moore and Howard say they can consistently count on hearing adults crack up at the reference, coursing through the audience like a ripple the kids never notice. \nThe duo continues, \u201cWe kept thinking, well, at some point we\u2019ve got to\n  pull this back, but as we kept building the scene and designing it, we\n  kept saying, well, there\u2019s nothing really offensive about this.

But it really puts you\n  into that mindset.\u201d\n\nThey have much more to say about this scene in the Entertainment Weekly article that the above quote comes from.\n"}, {"question": "What were all the references in Deadpool?", "answer": "\nThis answer is a Community Wiki, so if you want to add anything to it, just edit it.\nDen of Geek had an incredible article on this. I've used a lot of information from their site.\nAll references below are from Den of Geek, unless stated otherwise.\nDeadpool creators: \n\n\u201cRob L.\u201d written on one Goon\u2019s coffee cup - a reference to one of Deadpool\u2019s creators, Rob Liefeld. He and Fabian Nicieza worked on the comics. He actually cameos in the film, at the Hellhouse. Surprisingly, there isn't a single reference to his inability to draw feet.\nDuring the freeway battle, there are exits named Liefeld Rd, Nicieza St, and Miller Street (Tim Miller the Director).\n\nRyan Reynolds:\n\nThe cover of People Magazine\u2019s November 17, 2010 issue (where Ryan Reynolds was named \u201cSexiest Man Alive.\u201d)\nThe inside of one goon's wallet is seen in the opening credits, containing a picture of the goon dressed as a superhero with a bright green mask and ring, referring to Reynolds playing Hal Jordan in DC Comics' Green Lantern film.\nWade remarks that he doesn\u2019t want his superhero suit to be green or animated. Both a reference to Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Green Lantern stint and the fact that the Green Lantern costume was entirely animated.\nWade happens to own an action figure of Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine for the sake of jabbing at that movie\u2019s terrible portrayal. As a joke, he wants to show Vanessa the greatest thing in the world, and picks up the toy... and the vinyl music record it's sitting on top of. He shows her the record.\nAjax suggests sewing Wade's mouth shut. While working in the context of the scene, Wade tells him that it's a bad idea, a reference to the unpopular depiction of Wade Wilson in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\nWhen freaking out after Vanessa's kidnapping, Wade mutters a line beginning with \"Cock juggling [inaudible]...\" which could be a reference to a similar line used by the character played by Ryan Reynolds in Blade: Trinity.\nOn the Deadpool board in Sister Margaret's someone bet on R Reynold to die.\nWhile recovering after the freeway fight, Wade is being consoled by his blind friend, who urges him again to go after Vanessa. Wade demurs, citing his looks, and adds, \"Do you think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting ability?\"\n\nComic traits:\n\nDeadpool's initial costume is white. This might be a nod to his X-Force attire, or his X-Force team member, Fantomex (who's pretty similar to Deadpool in character).\nDeadpool breaks the fourth wall, talking directly to the viewer at times and being well aware that he\u2019s fictional. This aspect of the character has been around since the late-90s.\nDeadpool remarks that he looks like he was bitten by a radioactive shar-pei. Not only is this an easy Spider-Man reference, but it\u2019s also a reference to Cable/Deadpool #2 from way back in 2004 where Deadpool compared himself to Ryan Reynolds mixed with a shar-pei, which is the frame that got Ryan interested in playing Deadpool in the first place. It came full circle.\n\n\u201cYa, I love the character. I\u2019ve always loved the character. I remember reading one of the Deadpool comic books, and somebody asked Deadpool what he looks like. And he said he looks like a cross between a Shar-Pei and Ryan Reynolds. And I was like, I really, really wanna play this guy at some point. I thought it was pretty cool. It\u2019s a guy that knows he\u2019s in a comic book. How hard is it to shoot that properly? That\u2019s not something they put in Wolverine nor would it belong in that universe.\u201d\n\nWhen beating up Ajax, Deadpool refers to himself as being from Regina, Saskatchewan. Deadpool's nationality is something that bounces back and forth in the comics depending on the writer. Some say he's American while others say Canadian. The latest run with him has basically solidified the idea that he's Canadian.\nWeasel suggests Wade should star in a horror movie and likens him to Freddy Krueger. It's a comparison that's been made several times in the comics, most recently by Kate Bishop Hawkeye, who thought it was a Halloween costume and was instead mortified to realize it was actually Deadpool.\nWith a knife in his skull, Deadpool sees little cartoon characters crowding around Vanessa. Ever since Daniel Way took over writing Deadpool (starting with Wolverine Origins #21), he started a regular gag where Deadpool would see the world differently like that. It's been referred to as Pool-o-Vision.\nWade gets ready for the final battle with the line, \"Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas.\" During Vol 1, and Cable/Deadpool, he randomly says chimichangas and some of the fandom latched on. In Cable/Deadpool #13, Deadpool is in a restaurant that makes the best chimichangas on the island. Then he specifically says \"Don't even like chimichangas all that much. I just love saying it.\". He immediately orders an Enchilada instead. That line has been ignored, and somehow the fandom stuck to the idea that he loves chimichangas. This is also a reference to the famous \"Time to make the donuts\" commercial for Dunkin Donuts from the 1980's.\nWade\u2019s incident with the pizza guy is heavily based on a scene from Daniel Way\u2019s run with the character. It\u2019s from Deadpool v.2 #10. Despite the movie\u2019s R-rating, the comic version is a lot darker. It isn\u2019t just a case of stalking countered by intimidation, nor is it about teenagers. The pizza boy ruined Deadpool\u2019s client\u2019s high school life, which carried over into her adult life, due to spreading some horrible rumors about her.\nThe playful, sexual way Wade messes with the pizza boy ties into Deadpool\u2019s pansexual nature, which director Tim Miller insisted they play up. There are loads (heh) of other references to Wade's fluid sexuality in the movie, too. Arguably, many people believe, based on different interpretations of the character's history, that it's just a way Wade talks and acts to mess with people's heads while working/fighting.\nDuring one scene, Wade is wearing a shirt with Bea Arthur on it. In a running gag that started in Cable/Deadpool #1, Deadpool considered Bea Arthur to be the sexiest woman in show business.\nThe pizza is from Feige's Famous Pizza. Kevin Feige is the president of Marvel Studios. (Thanks, Jim the Nickel and bittergourd!)\n\nVanessa Carlysle:\n\nVanessa Carlysle, otherwise known as Copycat, is Deadpool\u2019s original flame in the comics. Technically, she appeared first in New Mutants #98 along with Deadpool, in the sense that in the comics she\u2019s a shape-shifter and was really pretending to be other new character Domino. They didn't reveal that fact until several issues later. Prior to that life, much like in the movie, she was a prostitute.\nAfter Vanessa makes a reference to Empire Strikes Back involving Yoda, Wade remarks that it's like he made her in a computer. Likely an allusion to the movie (and later TV show) 'Weird Science' about a couple nerds who made the perfect woman using their computer.\nThe idea of Wade wanting to leave Vanessa behind out of fear of her seeing him die of cancer is lifted straight from the comics. It was briefly shown in the first Deadpool miniseries, Deadpool: The Circle Chase (1993), and was revisited in Deadpool v.1 #-1.\nWade jokes about \"boomboxing\" the WHAM! song \"Careless Whisper,\" which is a nod to 'Say Anything'..., the 1989 movie where John Cusack holds his stereo over his head, playing \"In Your Eyes\" by Peter Gabriel in order to serenade his girlfriend.\nAs reader Francisco Louren\u00e7o Ribeiro points out, the scene of Vanessa going into the rainy alley to get kidnapped by Ajax may be based on the scene in Spider-Man where Mary Jane is saved from muggers and Peter hides in the shadows. This is supported by Weasel telling Deadpool, \"Go get her, tiger,\" what with \"tiger\" being Mary Jane's trademark thing.\n\nWeasel:\n\nWeasel has been Deadpool\u2019s go-to weapons and tech guy since the first Deadpool miniseries, The Circle Chase. He was created by Fabian Nicieza and Joe Madureira. Real name Jack Hammer (yes, really), Weasel is actually improved by the movie\u2019s take. Mainly because in the comics, Weasel is the one constantly taking abuse from Wade, which just makes Wade look like a bully. (Side note, Wade was a bully, an actual villain, at the start. His relationship with Weasel improves greatly as Deadpool becomes an anti-hero and then on his current heroic attempts).\nSister Margaret\u2019s School for Wayward Children, otherwise known as the Hellhouse, is another Joe Kelly creation, appearing in Deadpool v.1 #1. Run by an old man named Patch, the Chicago-based clubhouse was a place for mercenaries to hang out and get job offers. This was mainly used as an excuse to have Deadpool constantly butt heads with his main (at the time) arch-nemesis T-Ray.\nLiefeld is one of the names on the Dead Pool (see? Told ya there were more references to Deadpool's creators). Wade even acknowledges one of the mercs by that name.\nWhen Wade orders the blowjob drink at the bar, the waitress' name is Kelly. Joe Kelly wrote Deadpool in the late-90s and is credited as being the writer who truly gave him life as a three-dimensional character.\nThe Dead Pool board has a lot of Easter egg names mixed in there. Hell if I have the full list, but I did see \"M. Tyson\" and \"S. LaBeouf\" mixed in there. Give it some time. I'm sure someone will have a screenshot. A few other names noticed are C. Sheen, K West, W Wilson, V Putin, R Reynolds, TJ Miller,B Cosby, O Osbourne, J Nelson, L Lohan, and M Cyrus.\nThe Dead Pool is a thing from the comics, but not at the Hellhouse. It was originally at the Hospice, where rejects and failures from the Weapon X program were sent to die (peacefully, but it turns out worse).\n\nAjax:\n\nThe villain of the story is Ajax, otherwise known as Francis. He first appeared in Deadpool v.1 #14, created by Joe Kelly and Walter McDaniel. Originally known as the Attending (Ajax was his cyborg upgrade), he was a Weapon X experiment with super-strength, speed, etc. and also couldn\u2019t feel pain. Since he was a complete sociopath, the government decided he wasn\u2019t worth using as a superhero. Instead, he became an orderly at the Hospice, the Weapon X den where Wade was eventually (illegally) experimented on.\nThe dialogue about last words when Deadpool is about to kill Ajax is extremely similar to the conversation Nick Fury and Baron Von Strucker had in Secret Warriors before Fury shot Von Strucker in the head. Probably just a coincidence.\n\nColossus:\n\nColossus, real name Piotr Rasputin, is the oldest Marvel character in this movie, debuting in Giant-Size X-Men #1 in 1975. He was created by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum. Despite his big inclusion in this movie, he has very little history with Deadpool in the comics. They fought briefly during the Daniel Way run of Deadpool and in a time-travel story, the two were in a future incarnation of the X-Men. He's just as much a boy scout in the comics as he is in the movie. The movie really plays up the Papa Bear aspect.\nDeadpool compares Professor Xavier to Heaven's Gate, a religious cult that existed for a few decades and made news in 1997 when its members killed themselves, believing that their souls would be picked up by UFOs and brought to Heaven.\nDeadpool destroying his own limbs in an attempt to fight Colossus and failing every step of the way is a bit of a reference to the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In the original leaked script, Deadpool even calls it out more blatantly. He even references Colossus as RoboCop (\"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!\"), which goes well with the agonizing, Verhoeven-esque, over-the-top violence of the scene.\nColossus talks about bringing Deadpool to the Professor, and he asks if it's going to be James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart, as the new timeline thing is really confusing. Obviously he's breaking the fourth wall and talking about the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past and how it affects the X-Men movies' continuity.\nDeadpool warns about spoilers for 127 Hours, which ended with James Franco cutting off his own limb to escape.\nWhen Deadpool's blood splatters all over Colossus' face, he jokes, \"Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.\" A reference to the book of the same name by Judy Bloom, which is about a girl having her first period.\nThe way Deadpool falls off the bridge and lands in a garbage truck as it drives off is very much like what happens to John Cusack in the movie Better Off Dead, though his fall was far more accidental. (Thanks to Oeno)\n\nNegasonic Teenage Warhead:\n\nNegasonic Teenage Warhead, named after the awesome song by Monster Magnet, was a short-lived character introduced by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely in New X-Men #115 back in 2001.\nDeadpool calls her Ripley from Alien 3, mainly due to having the same short hair and stern outlook. He also refers to her as Sinead O'Connor, a musician known for her shaved head, and quotes her song \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\"\nNegasonic's outfit is closer to the classic outfits of the original X-Men. It also plays well into the joke from the first X-Men movie where they mention the lack of yellow spandex. It was mostly a jab at Wolverine's comic self, but Cyclops is living in a glass house on that one. (Thanks to Jack9Crow)\nNegasonic comments on how often the X-Mansion is destroyed. [thanks to @nickson104]\n\nAngel Dust:\n\nAngel Dust is another random character, though at least the power set is correct. She was created by Geoff Johns and Shawn Martinbrough in Morlocks #1 in 2002. Coincidentally, this would be the second time a villain of a Ryan Reynolds movie is a Johns creation. Green Lantern featured the entity Parallax.\nAngel Dust has a thing about chomping on matchsticks and Deadpool asks if she's a big Stallone fan. In the Sylvester Stallone movie Cobra, he spends the entire movie chomping on a matchstick.\n\nBlind Al:\n\nBlind Al is another Joe Kelly creation, appearing first in Deadpool v.1 #1. A motherly figure, she\u2019s actually Deadpool\u2019s prisoner in the comics. It\u2019s played for laughs for a while until later going into how messed up their relationship actually is. Deadpool occasionally put her in The Box, a literal torture chamber for various imagined transgressions, before his heroic turn. While written out at the end of Kelly\u2019s run, she has shown up here and there over the years to give advice.\nDeadpool refers to her as Mrs. Magoo. Mr. Magoo is a cartoon character created in the 1949, known for getting into comedic situations due to his blindness.\nHe also calls her Ronnie Milsap at one point. Milsap is a blind country singer.\nIn the scene when Blind Al is being introduced, \"Hit the Road, Jack\" by Ray Charles is played in the background (Ray Charles is blind). [thanks to @Dunno]\n\nDavid Cunningham (Worm):\n\nWade befriends fellow experiment David Cunningham. Cunningham is very much supposed to be Worm from the comics. Worm was created by Joe Kelly and Steve Harris in Deadpool/Death Annual \u201998. That issue is the basis for this whole segment of the movie where Wade is tortured and gets his powers. In the comics, he was also a Weapon X reject, in the Hospice, with a cybernetic eye. This is likely why one of his eyes in the movie is a different color than the other.\n\nBob:\n\nDeadpool runs into an enemy named Bob that he appears to be old friends with. Ever since debuting in Cable/Deadpool #38, Bob, Agent of Hydra has been Wade's ever-suffering sidekick. Come to think of it, Wade has a lot of ever-suffering sidekicks. Since Hydra is a Marvel property tied to Captain America/Avengers that Fox has no access to, he is made a generic goon of Francis. I doubt Francis offers full dental either.\nDeadpool mentions that Bob's wife's name is Gail. While Bob is married to a woman named Allison in the comics, Gail is almost definitely a reference to Gail Simone, considered to be one of the best Deadpool writers despite writing a relatively few issues.\n\nDeadpool Post-Credits\n\nThe post-credits sequence is a take on Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, down to the setting and bathrobe and the demand that the viewers go home. Oh, and the \"chicka chick-aaaah!\"\nHe jokes about Sam Jackson showing up with an Eye Patch, a reference to the revolutionary post-credits scene from 'Iron Man'. Which Samuel L Jackson was paid handsomely for.\nDeadpool confirms Cable will be in Deadpool 2. The son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pr...forget it. Explaining who he is would take too long. He's from the future, he's Deadpool's original nemesis in New Mutants #98 where Deadpool was introduced, and they eventually starred in their own buddy comic for 50 issues as well as a recent digital series. They're the odd couple of the mutant corner of Marvel.\n\nOther\n\nDeadpool owns an Adventure Time watch. The joke is basically the reference, I guess. You're on the internet. You already know what Adventure Time is. You have to. The joke also being that a fully grown man like Wade watches a children's cartoon.\nWade also likes Voltron, Hello Kitty, and other childish franchises.\nWhen joking about fondling Wolverine's balls, he starts speaking in an Australian accent and mentions \"down under,\" a more direct reference to Hugh Jackman's nationality.\nOne of the prominent signs on the freeway says \"Parker Boulevard.\" As reader Mike Priest points out, this could very well be a reference to Spider-Man. My first reaction was that it might be a reference to comic writer Jeff Parker, but that guy's written like a single Deadpool comic in his career, so that's not too likely.\nDeadpool constantly refers to the recruiter character as Agent Smith, likening him to the cold, suit-wearing villain from the Matrix movies.\nLater in the movie, Deadpool attacks the recruiter while calling him Jared and makes a joke about a footlong. This would be innocent on its own, but considering Wade made jokes earlier about the recruiter seeming like a child molester, this is most definitely a topical joke about Jared Fogle's recent arrest and conviction for being a pedo.\nJoking about Batman and Robin\u2019s sexuality is old hat, but most famous for Fredric Wertham\u2019s attempts to bring down the comics industry with his book Seduction of the Innocent.\nWhen Ajax and Angel Dust leave Sister Margaret\u2019s, Weasel makes fun of them for dressing like they\u2019re going to go watch Blade 2. Blade Trinity starred Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, another Marvel Deadpan Snarker character which inspired many to think he\u2019d play the perfect Deadpool. Frankly most of Reynold's characters are Deadpan Snarkers.\nThe way Deadpool impales the final goon with two katanas and holds him up is very reminiscent of the Adam Kubert cover of Wolverine #88, the first ever meeting between Wolverine and Deadpool.\nStan Lee has his expected Marvel cameo, this time as a strip club DJ. What\u2019s funny and notable about this is that Stan Lee didn\u2019t co-create a single character in this movie. Explicitly called out as a Glorified Cameo during the title sequence, similarly to many other roles in a tongue-in-cheek manner.\n\nStan Lee did create 'Stripperella', a mature (non-porn) adult cartoon super-heroine, who is a Stripper, making the cameo less random than it seemed.\n\nVoltron: Defender of the Universe was a cartoon from Japan in the mid-1980s where five pilots would control giant lion mechs, then combine them into a sword-swinging robot.\nWade talks about his Liam Neeson nightmare, where he goes into a tangent about the Taken trilogy without outright identifying the movies by name. The choice of Liam Neeson as the butt of the joke might be due to Neeson's role in Darkman, another movie about a super-antihero with disfigured face. (Darkman was directed by Sam Raimi, who also directed the 2002\u20132007 Spider-Man trilogy.)\nDuring the bit where Deadpool's freaking out over hitting a woman, he throws off an attacker while yelling, \"Get off me, spider monkey!\" As pointed out by reader Jason Aniceto, this is taken from the first Twilight, where Edward tells Bella, \"You'd better hang on tight, spider monkey,\" while she was on his back in similar fashion.\n\nIt's more likely a reference to Deadpool Vol 2 #19-21, 'WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN'. Deadpool and Spiderman team up to stop Hit Monkey. Yes, Marvel has a character that's a non-talking monkey that's a hitman. You don't believe me.\n\nWhen going after Ajax, Deadpool brings with him a copy of the November 25, 2008 People Magazine where Hugh Jackman was awarded \"Sexiest Man.\"\nOne of the experiments in the facility where Wade gets his powers has bones sticking out of their back. This is likely a reference to X-Men character Marrow, who constantly has them jabbing out of her back and can regenerate them at will. Marrow is also in the video game series Marvel vs. Capcom, where Deadpool was added as a fighting character in MvC 3. Alternatively, it can be a reference to Spyke, a mutant that was introduced in the cartoon X-Men Evolution, and is Storm's nephew. He also has bone spikes like Marrow.\nThe final battle between Deadpool and Ajax takes place on a dismantled SHIELD helicarrier. The original concept art makes this pretty blatantly obvious, but the artist was asked to downplay the resemblance (presumably for legal reasons).\nBefore the end credits, he calls himself \"your friendly neighborhood pool guy\", yet another jab at how similar he is to Spider-Man (whose trademark catchphrase refers to himself as \"your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\"). They are constantly confused for each other in-universe in the comics.\nDeadpool calls out the lack of inhabitants at the X-Mansion other than Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus, questioning whether the studio could not afford any other X-Men. [thanks to @nickson104]\nDuring the animated end credits, Deadpool dangles in the upper right corner of the frame while upside down and apparently from a web string, much like Spider-Man is seen to do. \nWhen Negasonic Teenage Warhead is finishing her Tweet before attacking Angel Dust, the fuselage of a wrecked aircraft is in the background. The registration is C-FLNT, a likely nod to Captain Flint of the Howling Commandos.\nOne scene has a closeup of Wade's headboard covered in stickers. Some of them resemble the TOPPS 90's X-Men stickers, one of which looked like Apocalypse, the villain for the upcoming X-Men movie.\nDuring the final battle he has stapled a photo of Hugh Jackman on his face, just in case he loses his mask.\nThere are also at least 3 Monty Pythonesque references. The competition between Wade and Vanessa over who had the shittiest upbringing is a nod to the \"Four Yorkshiremen\" skit, the \"Fight\" between Deadpool and Collosus is overtly similar to the Black knight scene in \"Monty Python and Holy Grail\", and when trying to guess Ajax's name, Wades last guess is Basil Fawlty (from Fawlty Towers) which while not from Monty Python, stars John Cleese, arguably Monty Python's most famous member.\nWhen demanding that Ajax fix the damage done to him, Deadpool refers to his disfigurement as a \"butter face\". This refers to an old sexist joke:\n\nOne guy turns to another and says, \"Look at that hottie!\".\n  The other replies, \"She's a butterface.\"\n  \"What?\"\n  \"Y'know, a butterface.

The biggest example for that is during the scene when he falls of the building during the fight with Batman even when he is falling, he laughs hysterically before Batman catches him with grapple gun.\nHarvey Dent was Joker's biggest ace. When he gave him the gun he took the gamble, had Harvey blown Joker's brain then the Joker wouldn't have cared about his death but he surely would've had the last laugh because he took the symbol (white knight) of the city and drove him to insanity and made him a killer. The Joker's primary ambition was to make Batman do that but Batman was completely incorruptible so he resorted to the next best person in Gotham city which happened to be Harvey Dent.\nEven Joker openly admits that in the above mentioned scene to batman.\n\nBatman: This city just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good.\nJoker:  Until their spirit breaks completely. Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent, huh? And all the heroic things he's done. You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for Gotham's soul in a fist-fight with you? No, you need an ace in the hole; mine's Harvey.\nBatman: What did you do?\nJoker: I took Gotham's White Knight and brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know, is like gravity: all it takes is a little push. (Laughter)\n\nEdit:\nI have been thinking about this question furthermore. I believe the only reason Joker walked out of the room alive in the hospital scene with Harvey Dent was because the coin toss favored him. As we learn later in further scenes Harvey only shot the people whom the coin toss didn't favor which included Batman as well.\n"}, {"question": "How did Sherlock survive the fall?", "answer": "\nHe jumped into the truck which was in front of the pavement and drove off as soon as he pushed a body out wearing his clothes or he landed in the truck and then rolled from the truck to the pavement.\nRemember how he told Watson exactly where to stand?\n(to make sure he could only see from the correct angle)\nWatson was delayed by a bicycle hitting him as he ran over.\n(to give Holmes and co some extra time)\nWatson was pushed back by bystanders telling him not to look?\n(so he would not spot any inconsistencies but would see enough)\nSuddenly medics appeared and rushed off with the body?\n(to prevent Watson, or anyone else, looking too closely)\nHolmes remarking to Molly that he needed her?\n(either for a spare corpse or to falsely pronounce him dead)\nThis fits well with the books where Holmes often keeps Watson in the dark, especially as Watson is a very poor liar.\n"}, {"question": "What do actors actually inhale when their characters snort cocaine or smoke crack?", "answer": "\nBecause of powdered milk's resemblance to cocaine and other drugs, powdered milk is sometimes used in film-making as a non-toxic prop that may be inhaled.\nOther methods listed on nypost.com are -\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually cornstarch, but you have to put a bit of baby powder\ninto it, because starch is too sticky and heavy,\u201d says Gillian\nAlbinski, the property master on Homeland.\n\n\u201cI always use powdered lactose,\u201d says longtime prop master Mychael\nBates, who worked on 2011\u2019s Horrible Bosses.\n\nColin Farrell didn\u2019t seem to mind.

This is from the moment they arrive into costume or hair/makeup at base, not when they get to set.\nOne child takes at minimum two, if not three or four, supervising adults - a chaperone (a professional who does this for a living), and one or two parents, who usually have not a clue what's going on. A lot of the day is spent keeping the parents fed, watered and amused as they look after the child, meaning a runner will often be assigned to them too, to fetch and carry. This small entourage will move as a single unit for the whole day.\nThe child is only allowed to be on set for 30 minutes at a time, with a total maximum of 2 hours on set per day. Additional breaks can be taken at the request of the chaperone or parent.\nSo, you bring the child in at the very last possible moment, onto a set with perhaps 100 other people - total strangers to the child. Also bear in mind that the set might be an ordinary living room... which only has three walls and a whole gantry of lights above an open ceiling... built from plywood in a massive open space which is mostly otherwise in darkness; vaguely revealing other strange wooden boxes off in the distance. Not exactly an ordinary situation to be thrust into.\nIf there was time, they have been introduced and had a little 'getting-to-know-you' time with the principal actor they need to interact with.\nYou then have 30 minutes to get them to do the one thing they are needed for, in sync with any other relevant action and dialog the adults need to perform.\nYou cannot overrun. Someone will be timing this to the absolute second, from the time they entered the studio. This is serious.\nIt can take something like a minute or more to get from everyone ready to go to actually calling \"Action\". All the precursor of calling the roll, hearing everyone's 'rolling/speed' responses from camera and sound, slating each camera, getting the camera op's opening shot 'set' and then all you need is the kid to behave for just 3 seconds\u2026 on cue.\nAnyone who thinks a child under 3 will concentrate for the 3 seconds they appear in close-up hasn't actually tried to do this when there are 100 cast and crew around them, with some poor, overworked chaperone and the kid's mum, waving teddies and forced-cheerfully shouting \"Over here, cherub! Look at the bunny!\" in an increasingly frustrated manner... whilst the crew just keeps on rolling, in the hope they'll get one eventually.\nA couple of pics of random sets - just to give an idea of how daunting it may be for a small child thrown into this situation. Movie sets do not meet anyone's definition of 'normal'. An adult will rapidly acclimatise, a child less-so.\nThere's too many people, too much dark; you can't see out past the lights, too much weird, too much distraction.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@mchetwalker/what-is-the-essential-role-played-by-a-focus-puller-on-a-film-set-87cd338c32ce\n\nSource: https://film.utah.gov/blog/green-production-disney-andi-mack/\n...and all this is after the journey they took to even get to set - this Daily Mail article from a few years ago has some aerial shots of some of the large London studios.

Real people have those types of conversations.\nIt humanizes the characters, whilst, at the same time, setting up the disconnect between their words and their actions.\nTake that hamburger conversation..\nThey're on their way to work, not at work. So they catch up, talk about their lives and other minutae not related to work, just like ordinary folks. When they get to work... they switch modes.\nBut even then, they were having a conversation about burgers which ties into the subsequent action when they recover that briefcase.\nHere's an excellent comment I found which explains it perfectly.\n\nIn Pulp Fiction, almost every line is brilliant in a distinct way. From the poetic prose of some of the monologues, to the quick and profane exchanges between actors, this movie has it all, and it is all great. Tarantino writes with a knack for realistic dialogue. His characters talk about real things and often discuss day-to-day proceedings which seem irrelevant to the plot. This brings the characters to life, but what QT also often does is subtly slip that seemingly random dialogue back into the plot.\nFor example, in Pulp Fiction Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) have the best written conversation about hamburgers in the history of cinema. They compare quarter pounders in America to those in France while on the way to kill some young men who ripped off their boss. The French name for the burger reappears in the dialogue later when they\u2019re \u201cin character\u201d in the apartment of the guys they\u2019ve been sent to whack. The use of such ordinary conversation is almost hilarious at times, as Tarantino\u2019s characters may be discussing the simplest things while carrying out a contrasting action- like stashing a body or dealing drugs.\nSource\n\n"}, {"question": "Why does Darth Vader not use the Force to prevent Luke from falling?", "answer": "\nIn his earlier conversation with Emperor, he says that either Luke will join us or die. \n            VADER\n    If he could be turned, he would \n    become a powerful ally.\n\n            EMPEROR\n    Yes.

Repetition simply drills certain things into our heads. But beyond that, I think this is mainly about emotional complexity and intimacy. Our protagonist is unravelling and this is portrayed through a monologue (or soliloquy) into a mirror where he unknowingly shares his emotions with us. This device harks all the way back to Hamlet, but here, it's imbued with realism through Bickle's psyche and demeanor that De Niro (who improvised the lines) conveys in a chillingly natural way.\nThe scene is also oddly playful, putting us in Bickle's shoes (what we see is his reflection) as we play make-believe with him, maybe even triggering memories where we imagined standing up to someone, or practised speeches in front of a mirror - but contrasting it with his fractured mind and violent plans. This establishes a connection between us and him but also a repulsion, given the dangerous context; We also feel sorry for him: Not only does he seem delusional, but \"I'm the only one here\" also tells us just how lonely he is.\nIn short, I think it's memorable because it's a simple, short and naturally delivered phrase that actually represents a scene and character with a surprising amount of complexity. It's relatable but also scary and deeply troubling, which is why it ended up encapsulating Bickle's state of mind for us.\n"}, {"question": "How could the Starks convince the other Lords that this character was guilty?", "answer": "\nThis is not a democratic court; it is a royal judgment. \nAs Jon's nominated proxy, Sansa carries all the powers of a \"King [queen] in the North\". It is her sentence, and she does not need to seek the approval of the lords to carry it out.\nLittlefinger's behaviour does little to redeem him for his actions, and in some cases he outright admits the crimes levelled against him (such as the murder of Lysa Arryn, although he professes a benevolent motive).\nIn the example above, as with all his accused crimes, the person he has to convince in order to be pardoned is Sansa Stark; and as she is accusing him of his crimes, this isn't going to happen. Sansa has her own direct experiences of Littlefinger, along with the counsel of her sister and the three-eyed Raven... and Baelish co-ordinated events that led to the rape of the proxy Queen in the north.\nAll Sansa needed/wanted was a recent crime to provide the context for a fresh trial. Littlefinger's conspiracies were easily tantamount to this. The lords would have accepted her judgement even if Baelish hadn't confessed to his crimes, tried to flee justice etc.\nEdit: for the question of why the Knights of the Vale belayed the order of protection; Little-finger just admitted to murdering Lisa Arryn, their Lady Regent. He also professed his reason to be \"to protect you [Sansa]\", a claim which Sansa refutes and counters that he was acting in self interest. Regardless of motive, he just admitted Regicide. They were never his own soldiers, they were house Arryn's; and he just confessed to a Capital crime against that house.\n\nTo be clear: No one in that room is going to come to Little-fingers defense unless they are compelled (through honor, duty or obligation) to react. Baelish was a necessary evil these people were being forced to endure. Little-finger believed himself to be hated, but indispensable. His power of statecraft was, however, always based on manipulation/subterfuge. \nThe Starks simply asked him to explain himself openly to a room full of accusers; denying him his usual method of individual manipulation. It for this reason he asks to speak to Sansa 'privately', and it is for this reason he is plainly rebuffed. Without being able to spin lies and turn actors against each other, he is powerless to defend himself against his crimes; and even admits some of them.\n"}, {"question": "Is it really as easy to knock someone out in real life as in the movies?", "answer": "\nDisclaimer: Violence is stupid and dangerous. A blow to the skull is often fatal. \nI wouldn't say it's easy, but there are several sweet spots on the skull that, when hit with sufficient force, is almost guaranteed to cause unconsciousness.\nI would suggest the upper part of the jaw bone or the temple. Both places are connected to the brain stem through nerves and/or arteries. A punch here will cause the force to reach your brain and shut you down.\nI also believe that it's an important factor whether you expect the punch or it lands like a lightning from a blue sky. The latter are by far the worst. You'll almost certainly wake up surrounded by panicked individuals with a severely swollen head and no clue as to what happened ... then you throw up.\nFound this on Quora: \n\nA bunch of studies of head injuries in primates were done at U Penn some years ago. Bottom line: it took 3 times less energy to knock an individual out with a ROTATIONAL blow (e.g. roundhouse punch) than with a TRANSLATIONAL strike (e.g. a jab).\nThere are 2 main mechanisms:\n1) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can cushion a linear blow, but not a\n  rotational one (the CSF and brain spin side by side in a rotational\n  movement) \n2) the upper brainstem and higher brain can twist on each other\n  because of their size, shape and relative positions (and the arteries\n  that supply them can also twist), kind of like an apple and its stem,\n  causing loss of function precisely where \"consciousness\" resides in\n  the brain (the reticular activating system)\n\nThe studies mentioned by the Quora poster might be any of the many studies that came out of the Head Injury Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, but is most likely referring (primarily) to \"Physical model simulations of brain injury in the primate\", by Margulies SS, Thibault LE, and Gennarelli TA (published in the Journal of Biomechanics in 1990).\n"}, {"question": "What kind of company is Initech?", "answer": "\nInitech is ostensibly a software company, but I don't think it could really exist.  I'll take your points one at a time.\n\nInitech hires computer programmers that \"update bank software for the 2000 switch\"\nThis would fit either a bank/credit union, or a software consulting company.\nInitech has access to \"the credit union software\"\nAgain, this would fit both.  Programmers at a consulting company absolutely need access to the source code in order to make changes.\nInitech has access to \"the credit union mainframe\"\nAccess to the mainframe pretty much eliminates \"consulting company.\"  I happen to work as a programmer at a bank through a consulting company.  There's no way any bank or credit union is going to give access to a consultant to run unchecked code on any system where it could cause harm.\nInitech's accounting department notices when the money goes missing\nThis also eliminates \"software consulting company\" from consideration.  A consulting company has their own accounting department that would track expenses and income for their own activities, not those of their customers.  The bank or credit union would notice the money goes missing, not Initech.\nInitech has a \"Corporate Accounts Payable\" department (although at least one transcriber disagrees with me and thinks it's \"Corporate Councils Payroll\")\nThis doesn't offer much information.  \"Accounts Payable\" is a common accounting term that any company would use.  Any kind of loan or purchase on credit would be recorded under accounts payable.  A banker would refer to it as a loan, but an accountant (or accounting software) might still call it by the more generic term.\nInitech has a \"Logistics\" department\nThis could go either way.  A bank would have a logistics department, but so might a consulting company that worked for a bank.\nInitech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers.\nAny company with an IT department has those.  In programming, a \"customer\" might be anyone who uses our software.  They can be internal or external to the company.  In my department we call the quants and bank officers who use our software to make investment decisions our customers.  Other departments write software for actual bank customers (people with checking or savings accounts).  Many of us don't talk directly with our customers.  Instead we communicate through a project manager or other intermediary.\n\nGiven all of this, I think your guess of \"subsidiary of a large financial corporation\" isn't far off.  I think #4 would still eliminate a subsidiary company though.  It's unlikely that the same subsidiary would handle both software development and accounting for the parent company.  So in summary, Initech appears to be some kind of amalgam of a bank and a software consulting company that doesn't exist in the real world.\n"}, {"question": "Why is the spoken German in many US films and TV shows so inaccurate?", "answer": "\nBecause it's a level of detail that was considered irrelevant for the show's development\nAs a software developer and general IT nerd, I am constantly faced with this principle. Many, many TV shows and movies forgo showing a correct approach, and opted for the most minimally correct display of IT, because they assume it's a pointless detail.\n\nI think this is the most obvious example. You don't even need to be an IT expert to understand that this is completely ridiculous.\nFrom CSI: \"I will create a GUI interface using visual basic to track the killer's IP address\". This is technical lingo, but it is pulled out of context. This is the equivalent of a car mechanic saying \"I will crank the carburator through the horsepower, so that I can clutch the shaft\". The words themselves sound thematically correct, but there is no meaning to this random succession of words.\n\nI see it happen more with IT than German (as I don't speak German), but the principle is the same: being factually correct was deemed to much of an irrelevant detail, and no one wanted to put in the effort to research the correct thing to say.\n\nBecause no one working on the movie knew German well enough to spot the mistake\nEven if the script contained correct German, and the actor mistakenly messes up the grammar, it's still possible that no one catches it.\nIf the movie is recorded in the USA with an American crew, none of them having any German speaking skill, then no one will notice that the actor said it wrongly.\nSecondly, in the case of more than just a single line of foreign language, actors often go to special trainers to teach them how to sound like a true German, even if only for a few lines.  \nBecause of this, most of the people working on set will not correct the actor; since they know he has been trained to speak German and they know little or nothing about it. By comparison, they feel inadequate to highlight the (trained) actor's mistake.\n\nBecause it's a joke\nYou've mentioned How I Met Your Mother twice. In both cases, the butchering of the German language is intentional.\n\nIn the first example, HIMYM mocks the German language for having long words that sound like gibberish but actually have a very complex and nuanced meaning. If you think that's just not true, torschlusspanik.\nIn the second example, HIMYM mocks the German language again for sounding like gibberish. Heidi Klum's presence (since she is an actual German speaker) supports this joke. If an American actor had said it, the viewers could assume that the German sounded horrible because the actor was not able to speak German.

One actress imagined something terrible happening to her sister, and she delivered a very powerful performance (that got the crew all choked up).\nIf all else fails, the vapors from an onion can induce tears (but also cause redness), or a few drops of glycerin in the corners of the eyes can be released - but nothing beats real tears.\nI have also heard of directors bullying/belittling actors to the point of melt-down, just to get the shot they want.

It may indeed seem that this is a paradox since the humans couldn't have gone back in time to save themselves when they wouldn't have been saved in the first place.\nBut your problem is actually that you're searching a cause out of nothing where there is none. You are basically searching for the beginning of a circle. You assume that there could be an alternative timeline where humanity was not saved by the whole wormhole/tesseract stuff from its future self but then created the observed timeline by sending the message back. But such an alternative timeline does not exist and can't ever exist in the time concept of the movie, which follows the Novikov self-consistency principle in this regard. The point is that the timeline has always been this way and hasn't been created out of another timeline by some external influence, humanity has always been saved by its future self and will always safe its past self. If they hadn't saved themselves, they wouldn't exist to save themselves, as you realized yourself. You just have to stop looking for the beginning of what is a time loop, because there is no dedicated beginning, this time loop has always been part of the universe's unchangable time continuum.1\nThere is no point in reasoning about a reality where Cooper did not send the message to his daughter and himself in exactly the same way as he received them, since that is not the reality we're shown. It is not possible for Cooper to send other messages to himself than the ones he received or for the \"Bulk Beings\" to not open the wormhole in the future, since all that has basically already happened in Cooper's and earth's past. If he'd do it differently, he had received different messages in the first place. I know this may sound like a lame excuse or discussing away a supposed paradox just by its necessity. But it is really a fundemantally different approach of looking at time travel in contrast to, say, a different timeline whenever the past is changed. By saying that the past cannot ever in any slight way be changed -- and that's indubitably what the movie says -- the existence of any kind of paradoxa is basically avoided. One just has to accept the fact that the future 5D superhumans will at some point create that wormhole for us and will at some point create the tesseract for Cooper. Why they do this exactly is admittedly not answered by the movie, which just doesn't care about their reasons as they seem irrelevant here, but they certainly do it in exactly the same way as it already happened, because it happened in the way they did it.\nThis interpretation of an unchangable timeline is in fact a common way to avoid the problem of time paradoxa. A good other example for this is the movie Twelve Monkeys, where the end reveals\n\n that the timeline has always looked this way and the young Cole has always seen his older self die.\n\nAnd in fact when viewing that movie for the first time, it immediately struck me as one of the most plausible time travel movies ever, since it avoids any kind of paradox present in many other time travel movies by the simple consequence that the exact flow of events cannot ever be changed at all and every kind of time travel is already part of the causality chain that led up to it, even if in a circular way. (I have to add though, that discussions on this site have since made me doubt the unchangability of timelines in Twelve Monkeys a bit. But nevermind, Interstellar with its perfectly consistent depiction of a completely unchangable timeline can now take its place.)\n1 If you want a more metaphysical term for this, call it fate, but don't take that too seriously, I'm still talking about an entirely physical interpretation here and nobody wants to steal your free will ;-).\n"}, {"question": "First example of \u201cringing in ears\u201d sound design?", "answer": "\nI have unashamedly copied a paragraph from this rather comprehensive article covering tinnitus as a movie trope -  \nThe Cine-Files - The Tinnitus Trope: Acoustic Trauma In Narrative Film\nThey are discussing silence vs. whistling noise/ringing in ears [tinnitus] \n\n...although Arthur Hiller\u2019s The Out of Towners utilized the effect as\n  early as 1970, onscreen ears remained mostly silent for the rest of\n  the 20th century.

During this time he's away from his sister, son and the rest of his family. Simply being away distances him from the toxic atmosphere of the Lannisters. Now, this is by far the least significant of the events that lead to his character change, but I do think its worth noting.\nLady Catelyn, starting to know Brienne and honour - Season 2\nWhen he was set free, a few things happened. Firstly, he was trusted by Lady Catelyn to return to King's Landing and free her daughters. Whilst initially it seems likely he has no intention of keeping his word, the actions of Brienne will later lead to him becoming far more concerned with keeping this promise.\nSecondly, Brienne was tasked to be delivered and stuck absolutely steadfast to her task. In Valar Morghulis, the Season 2 finale, she even killed Stark men, all in the name of doing the task she was set - to deliver her prisoner in her service to Lady Catelyn.\nThis has a definite effect on Jaime - here is a woman who follows her code of honour. She is not on one side or another. Jaime appears to start thinking like this himself come Season 4 (and Season 5 and beyond).\nBrienne's peril and the Loss of his hand - Season 3 beginning\nHis life is built upon his strength as a knight. Despite the subtle changes already over him in Season 2, he still tries to fight Brienne in Season 3 and break free (although whether he would have killed her if he had bested her is definitely debatable). \nHowever, due to starvation and exhaustion (as the book is clear to point out), he is defeated. Fascinatingly, later that day, he shows one of his first genuine acts of kindness in the series - he tells Brienne she will be raped that night, and that she should not resist, or they will kill her as she is nothing to them. \nWhilst this may seem cold or hurtful, it's also truthful. He realised what could befall her and didn't want it to happen. He even goes as far as to lie about how her homeland, The Sapphire Isle, got its name (saying it's because of all the sapphires). This leaves the men to leave her alone in the hope of getting a ransom.\nAlready, it's clear that something about Brienne has gripped him. Perhaps she reminds him of a young Jaime? Despite this, he has certainly not changed yet. Instead, at this point, he simply appears to have some sort of grudging respect for her.\nEverything changes when he loses his hand. This was his greatest asset. He was a colossal fighter, the youngest ever Kingsguard member - and losing his hand stripped him of everything he had spent his life fighting for in a single swoop. He begins moping, and is furiously berated by Brienne for acting like a woman. Despite her fierce criticism, he actually follows her advice. She helps him beginning eating and drinking again. Once more, her strength and commitment to honour appears to sway him.\nThe Truth about the Mad King and Jaime - Season 3 - defining moment of change\nThe bath scene at Harrenhal, in Kissed by Fire is his defining moment of change. After slipping into a bath with Brienne, and initially insulting her, he completely opens up and tells her (and the audience, for the first time), the true story of the Mad King...\nOne of Jaime's biggest frustrations is the lack of respect he is given. He served under the Mad King, in the Kingsguard - the youngest ever member of the order. However, he learned (and we learn in A Storm of Swords) that he was chosen as a slight against Lord Tywin, so he wouldn't be the heir to Casterly Rock. Despite this, he remained in the Kingsguard.\nWe learn from the books in particular how difficult it was for him during this time. For example, when Brandon and Lord Rickard Stark (father of Ned) were murdered, he had to be reminded by Ser Gerold Hightower that he swore an oath to guard the king, not to judge him.\nFinally, when Rhaegar and Robert go to war, and it becomes clear The Targarayens will lose, The Mad King orders the city be set ablaze. He also orders Jaime to bring him his father Lord Tywin's head. This is the last straw for Jaime, who turns his back on his King and slaughters him. He could not stand by and watch the entire city be destroyed, and so many people to perish.\nHis reward? The title Kingslayer and an almost universal disdain for turning his back on the person he swore to protect. He broke his honour, and should have died protecting him, according to his oaths. This disdain and lack of respect led to resentment which continued to bubble inside him, making him crueller and more callous.\nI think this is the true final moment of change for Jaime. It's not that he becomes a good person. It's not that all his sins are forgiven. It's just that something inside changes and from that point on becomes linked to Brienne and determined to keep a sense of honour.\nWhen he collapses at the end of his story, she cries out for help for the Kingslayer - and he corrects her. His name is Jaime.\nRescuing Brienne - Season 3 ending\nAfter leaving Harrenhal for the capital, Jaime realises what is going to happen to Brienne, who has been left behind. He demands his group returns and rescues her from a bear, in a hideous gladatorial battle she's been forced into. Together, they depart for King's Landing. \nFor the first time, he has been able to save her. \nAnd he's actually done something honourable, which she appreciates - it's the first genuine appreciation he has had in a long time, and continues to change how he views both Brienne and the world.\nNew sense of honour and distancing from Lannisters - Season 4 beginning\nThis continues in Season 4, when he returns to the capital, but refuses his father's orders to leave King's Landing. He chooses to stay in the Kingsguard, to protect the King. Of course, with his stump hand he's of little use - it's his name and the legend of his fighting which affords him his respect. But, inspired by Brienne, he is determined to stay and redeem any honour he can.\nIn one of the more memorable scenes in Season 4, he has sex/rapes Cersei, next to Joffrey's body. This is unquestionably one of the most tortured and complex scenes of the series. At that moment, he both loves her and hates her. It's a connection to the long past he has, and yet a reminder of how far away from her he now is. He even tells her:\n\n\"You're a hateful woman, why have the gods condemned me to love a\n  hateful woman?!?\"\n\nThis moment forever changes their relationship.\nWhen next they meet, he is trying to convince her of Tyrion's innocence and is kicked out of her room. The dynamic between them (as of yet) has never recovered.\nThe action is brutal and horrendous. It shows his change, but also shows how cruel and cold he can still be. It's another reminder that the world of Game of Thrones is not simply good versus bad.\nBrienne's departure and a commitment to the future - Season 4 mid to end\nAt the start of Season 4, Jaime refuses to release Sansa to Brienne - but only because by this stage Lady Catelyn and Robb are dead and he genuinely believes she will be safer in the capital. \nWhen Joffrey dies though, Tyrion is arrest and Sansa is missing, he knows she is a prime suspect and is in grave danger.\nJaime sends Brienne, with new weapons and armour, on a mission to find Sansa and protect her - especially from his sister. This poignant scene reminds us of both how much he now respects and trusts her Brienne, and contrasts starkly with how much he distrusts his own sister, whom he pined over for so long whilst being captive.\nHis final act of honour in Season 4 is to rescue Tyrion from a fate he knows he doesn't deserve, setting in action a complex range of events that you'll see in Season 5 (and that will be continued beyond).\nConclusion\nHe is a wonderfully complex and bizarre character, with varying and often confusing attitudes towards both violence and other people. To quote from the GoT Wiki:\n\nJaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark\n  out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne from being\n  raped (and then fed to a bear) by Locke's soldiers. The difference\n  seems to be that after witnessing the deprivations [sic] of the Mad King,\n  needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he\n  decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will\n  ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because\n  had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his\n  sister, Cersie, the woman he loved, and all of their children would be\n  executed, so he felt he had no choice.\n\nThere is nothing simplistic about his character, but the one clear thing is his hatred of the lack of respect he is given for killing the Mad King. If Ned or Robert had done it, they would be heroes. Because he did it, breaking his oath, he is treated with contempt.\nWhen he meets Brienne though, loses his hand and finally confides in someone what he did and why, he changes. The look in Brienne's eyes during his speech tells a story too - suddenly his actions have a very different meeting.\nThis is the defining moment after which he completely changes. He is still ruthless, but rather than following his family's code of honour, he appears to follow his own - largely inspired by his adventure with Brienne.\n"}, {"question": "Why does Trinity's kiss revive Neo in The Matrix?", "answer": "\nFirst, a correction of a misconception. The Oracle never tells Neo he's not the one, he tells himself that. The quote from the Oracle/Neo is:\n\nOracle: Sorry, kid. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something.\nNeo: What?\nOracle: Your next life, maybe. Who knows? That's the way these things go.\n\nThe sorry is a little ambiguous, and could easily be taken to mean \"Sorry, you're wrong on that\". However, the last part of the conversation is the important part.\nWhen Neo gets \"killed\" in the Matrix, his body is still around, and consciousness presumably hasn't departed yet. Trinity confesses that she was destined to fall in love with the One, and she loves Neo, so he couldn't be dead.\nThis resonates with the consciousness that is still there, and he cognitively realizes and dissociates himself with the concept of death being tied to the Matrix, and is \"reborn\" in the Matrix. This fulfills all parts of the prophecy, Neo is on his \"next life\", Trinity is in love with him, and Matrix go boom.\n"}, {"question": "How can I find tv shows/films similar to one I like?", "answer": "\nThere are a couple of websites that can help find similar shows or movies:\n\nIf you go to the TV show or movie's Wikipedia page, scroll to the bottom and you'll see a box with the Categories for that page.  Often this will contain links to various genres or classes of TV shows and movies.  Clicking on those links will take you to lists of all the works that have been put into those Categories, so they'll share that similarity with the work you enjoyed.\nTV Tropes is a site that documents and classifies works (it covers TV shows and films, but many other things as well, such as books, manga, fanfic, etc.) based on genres as well as 'tropes' which are more specific plot/writing devices.  So you have pages that list various works that have casually killed off characters.  Similar to Wikipedia, if you head to a specific TV show or movie page, you'll get a list of tropes that this TV show or movie used.  Those trope pages will then have links to other works that are in the same genres or use the same tropes.\nIMDb documents TV shows and films and the people who work on them.  So if you like a specific actor, or the writing, or the directing of a TV show or film, hit up IMDb. You can look up a specific actor/writer/director and see everything they've worked on. Wikipedia also has some of this information, but IMDb tends to be more comprehensive as this is their specific focus.

But we don't really need to stop there.\nIn fact a big emphasis of the movie, beyond the WWII spy story that already offers many possibilities for \"imitation\", is the rather personal story of Alan Turing and his struggles with being homosexual in a time where that wasn't really accepted at all. So he himself is forced to play an imitation game, imitating a straight man.\n(As a side-note, the subtitle to the German version of the movie, \"Ein streng geheimes Leben\" (\"A top secret life\"), while maybe a little bit too much on the nose, emphasises this connection further.)\nThis is probably as valid an interpretation as the more technical ones presented in the other answers and the overall title is likely using that ambiguity for evoking meaning on multiple levels this way, just as the story itself juxtaposes Turing's personal problems with his historical achievements.\n"}, {"question": "Why do Disney parents usually die?", "answer": "\nI am answering subjectively here, but I think it really comes down to evoking even more sympathy for the main characters. Not only do they often have to battle difficult circumstances (i.e. being an outcast or something similar), but they also have to deal with being alone in the world. All of this creates genuine sympathy for the protagonists.\nThis Daily Mail article also addressed the issue. Although they agreed with my first point, they also had this fascinating theory:\n\nMight the death of Walt Disney's mother  -  and the lifelong guilt\nthis left her son with  -  be the catalyst for the death of parents in\nDisney?\nIn 1938 and riding high with the proceeds from his first big\nscreen movie Sleeping Beauty, Walt bought his mother, Flora, and his\nfather, Elias, a house in LA as a golden wedding anniversary present.\nWithin days of moving in, Flora complained about the stultifying\ntemperatures coming from the central heating boiler and her doting son\narranged for a swift replacement.\nDays later, Flora died from\nasphyxiation caused by the new, poorly-installed, boiler.\nMight Walt\nDisney's misplaced guilt over his mother's death have led him to\nairbrush parents  -  mothers in particular  -  out of his works?\nAnd\nhas that motivation, after his death in 1966, become a Disney\nblueprint?\nCertainly, it would explain the types of folk stories and\nfairytales that Disney has acquired for adaptation, even when there\nare numerous other traditional tales that feature a mother and father.\n\nFinally, it's also worth noting that not all movies have dead parents. This list shows the following Disney films as having both parents alive at the end of the film:\n\nLady and the Tramp\nSleeping Beauty\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\nMulan\nThe Incredibles\nPeter Pan\nBrave\nLion King 2\nTangled (although parent-like villain dies)\nHercules\n\nEdit:\nI whipped this answer up fairly quickly and really should have expanded on a few points. As many comments under the post have indicated, this \"style\" is a common trope. As TV Tropes express (rather tongue-in-cheek):\n\nParents Are Useless. They leave you and abuse you. Good Parents are\nhard to come by. It appears that the only decent parents are the dead\nones.\nThese are the parents that leave the characters behind, not by\nchoice, early on in the story, sometimes even before the story begins.\nThe characters are now all alone with no family. They may find a\nParental Substitute, but they may not always be the best guardians.\nThese often heroic characters will always have fond memories of their\nparents. That's because these parents did everything right while they\nwere alive. They spent time with their children and taught them\ninvaluable life lessons that they continue to keep even to this day.\nEven though the parents are gone now, the actions of the parents still\naffect the character and keep him going.\n\nFinally, it does make logical sense (from an animation point of view) for parents to die as it would most definitely cut down on production costs - although the life lessons learned from their deaths are obviously the main focus.\n"}, {"question": "What was Hans Gruber's plan in Die Hard?", "answer": "\nLet's go through the plan of Hans Gruber without the interference from John McClane.\n\nInfiltrate Nakatomi Tower with his goons and take the Christmas party-goers hostage.\nGet the vault password from Takagi (or kill him, doesn\u2019t really matter).\nHave Theo hack most of the vault locks.\nCall the police and pretend to be terrorists.\nAnnihilate the SWAT team with rocket launchers.\nWait until FBI shows up and cuts the power to the building, thus unlocking the last lock.\nSteal $640 million in bearer bonds.\nBlow up all the hostages on the roof with C4 when the FBI gunship shows up and escape in the confusion.\n\n(Source)\nHans was, as it seems so, great at planning.

These iconic photographs of Edison, the so called \u201cWizard of Menlo Park,\u201d equated the inventor\u2019s prolific output with the light bulb in the public\u2019s mind. The bulb came to stand for all of Edison\u2019s inventive prowess.\n\n\n\nAs a symbolic representation of Edison\u2019s slew of new ideas, it wasn\u2019t long before the the symbol came to be associated with the concept of new ideas generically.\nEdison\u2019s improvement of the electric light coincided with the world\u2019s new understanding of the of the word to describe someone, or something, as intelligent and inventive. That Edison\u2019s electric light bulbs were also bright like the sun, also helped to connect and cement these two concepts as analogous concepts in the minds of the public.\n\n\n\nWhat is the first movie/cartoon/show that used it for the first time?\n\nThen came along Felix\n\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Felix the Cat was the world\u2019s favorite animated animal. Created more than a decade prior to Mickey Mouse, Felix was the most popular cartoon character of the silent-film era. The anthropomorphic black cat, with his white eyes and a giant grin, was unable to speak because of the limitations of the medium, but Felix\u2019s emotions and thoughts were projected both through his exaggerated movements, and through various kinds of physical manifestations. When Felix was thinking, symbols and letters would sometimes appear over his head, and he would often use them as props: question marks became ladders, and musical notes became vehicles. It was in these symbolic images that we first see the light bulb used to represent a new idea.\n\n"}, {"question": "Is Borden's true identity real, or another ruse?", "answer": "\nWhile this is an interesting idea (and one which others have brought up on this site before, but I'm glad someone finally turned this into a proper question), I think it contradicts both the movie's plot and its overall themes. So no, I don't think there is much evidence in favor of this theory, but there is IMHO very well evidence against it, even if not so hard an evidence (and interpretation is still a free good).\nAs you yourself stated in your question, Borden and his twin both lived half a life for their entire life. And in turn this is \"their real trick and shows true dedication to their art\". This is what actually distinguishes Borden from Angier, who always tried to go the easy way and couldn't even imagine devoting his entire life to \"just a magic trick\". That is why Angier doesn't get behind the old Chinese magician's trick and Borden immediately realizes it, because the Chinese magician also devoted his entire non-stage life to keeping up the actual trick, like Borden did. And this is also the reason why Angier cannot believe Borden to just use a double for his Transported Man, since his own attempts with a double were not that fruitful and didn't work that well in the end, since he just wanted to do it the fast and easy way. So he thought there must be more to it than such a simple secret, but \"The secret impresses no one, the trick you use it for is everything\" (which might in the end even be the reason why you yourself think there to be more to Borden's trick, he achieved to deceive you, too ;-)).\nSo given this major theme of dedicating his whole life to his art in contrast to going the  fast and easy way to just to do a good show, Borden also using a cloning machine wouldn't really fit that well. And in the end Tesla himself said he never built such a thing, and while we might not believe him, he didn't have so much reason to lie at this point (having previously claimed to have built it until Angier finds out he didn't). And even more important, what would be the reason for Borden to send  Angier to Tesla if he knew he could build such a thing, since it was always planned as a distraction for Angier? While the coincidence might strike you as too coincidental, Borden sending him to the actual goal and just pretending it to be a wild goose chase would be much more of a plot-inconsistency. This also doesn't fit to Borden's reaction on this whole setup. He was as surprised as you and me that Angier actually \"survived\" the supposed murder, so he had absolutely no idea that Angier had a machine for cloning himself, which wouldn't be the case had he known that Tesla could construct such a device.\n\nSo that being said let's take a look at Tesla's significance as keyword and the supposed coincidence. There is still a reason for Tesla being used as keyword while coincidentally being able to build that machine, even if not as impressive a reason. In the movie he once was at a science fair or something similar in London, which both Angier and Borden attended as spectators. Borden might very well have seen Angier there and might have seen that Angier was impressed by Tesla's rather innovative science (that might have seemed like magic at that time), while all the others literally ran away in fear. So he thought Tesla might be someone that Angier could really believe to have built such a \"magic\" machine, which made him a reasonable keyword, given that he lived so far away.\nThe fact that Tesla could in the end really build such a thing was a coincidence Borden did not anticipate, and was actually an homage to Nikola Tesla's genius, using a bit of an overfictionalized version of the actual historical person. While not being an expert in this topic I know that even the real Tesla has a reputation for being quite an innovative person who had ideas that didn't get the respect or appreciation they deserved at their time (even if a duplication machine was maybe a bit over the top even for him), which also fits to his mythical introduction in the movie and his overall impressing presence (amazingly incarnated by noone else than David Bowie). So if anyone could have built such a machine at this time it would be Tesla and Borden might have been aware of this fact (even if he underestimated him and didn't really deem it possible) and assumed that Angier thought the same. So the writer of the script (or rather the novel it was based on) payed his tribute to the real Nicola Tesla by letting his fictional version achieve true scientific magic, while presenting quite a surprising, well yeah, coincidence to the audience. It wasn't so much a coincidence more than Borden and all of us just underestimating the genius of Nikola Tesla, like real history might have done, too.\n"}, {"question": "The most roles played by the same actor in a movie?", "answer": "\nI don't know the answer.

Chuck Jones heard him make that - or Treg Brown I guess, actually, the sound effects wizard at Warner Brothers - heard him make that noise and suggested that they record that for the Road Runner, and it's been the standard Road Runner noise ever since.\n\nNote that the sound is also spelled \"meep, meep\", \"hmeep hmeep\" or \"mweep, mweep\".\n"}, {"question": "What makes The Shawshank Redemption so cinematically important?", "answer": "\nI believe it is due to its great acting and very memorable plot.\nI'm not aware of any widely-used cinematic techniques that were invented due to the film. \nWhen the film was initially released, it struggled at the box office (it earned just $727,000 in its opening weekend). Despite this it received huge critical acclaim, garnered seven Oscar nominations and the rest was history - it's simply become one of the most popular, beloved films of all time.\nQuite why this occurred is due to a number of reasons:\n\nThe friendship of Andy and Red.  \nThe \"simplicity\" of Andy's escape.  \nThe longing for Andy to be free, given his ordeal.  \nThe uplifting nature of the finale of the film.  \nThe perseverance Andy showed.  \nMorgan Freeman's sensational voice.\n\nIt just touches on so many wonderful, magical issues and that has continued to resonate with audiences ever since.

The human skull is only 1/4 inch thick, so passing in and out of 3 skulls in succession would mean traveling through 1.5 inches of bone.  At close range, a handgun of average firepower could do this quite easily.\nOne bullet, seven wounds, one man killed, one wounded:\nOne of the bullets that hit John F. Kennedy entered the back of his neck, exited from the front of his throat, went into Governor Connally's back, out his chest, then into his forearm and out through his wrist, finally lodging just below the skin of his thigh.\nAlong the way, this bullet damaged one of Kennedy's vertebrae, shattered one of Connally's ribs, and broke a bone in Connally's wrist.  Thus we see that bullets have considerable momentum, and can often punch through multiple surfaces/victims, doing extensive damage on the way, before coming to rest.\nOne bullet, five wounds, one man killed:\nAn autopsy on a boy in India showed that he had died in an accidental shooting, and the bullet had caused five wounds (link:  warning - extremely graphic):  it entered below his knee, exited above it, entered his hand, exited his wrist, and finally, entered his chest.\nOne bullet, 17 wounds, 9 men hit:\nIt is said that an imperialist adventurer once tied 12 Unangan men together in Alaska and fired a single round from his rifle at them.  The round passed through eight of the men, lodging in the ninth.\n\nDeadpool:\nDeadpool isn't firing an anti-mat\u00e9riel rifle, nor is he firing the .50 BMG, but he has the next best thing:  his primary weapons are a pair of IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX .50 handguns.  These are among the most powerful handguns ever made, and they have more than enough muscle to do the job.\nGive him an infinite supply of ammunition and perfectly lined up skulls and he can score 3-for-1 shots all day long.  The only tricky part would be a real life scenario in which the targets are running around doing everything in their power to avoid being shot.\nAs Voo generously said in a comment:\n\nI used this calculator to get the kinetic energy of the bullet used in the Kennedy shooting (162grains, 1700fps) - 1410 joules). The desert eagle has a maximum muzzle velocity of 150fps and there's 325 grain heavy ammunition for it. So from a close enough distance at least the energy would be more than enough\n\nAnd Dan Neely added:\n\nThe 9mm (362 joules) and .45 ACP (432) are the mainstay defensive handgun rounds in the US. The DE .50 is several times more powerful and is one of the very few handgun rounds powerful enough to match a (low end) rifle bullet's performance. The reason why most handguns are much less powerful is to keep recoil manageable. Despite being absolutely huge for a handgun (mass reduces the felt effect of recoil), the DE .50 has a recoil that's beyond the ability of most people to manage and painful even then.\n\n"}, {"question": "Why do mouse cursors never align with actors' hand movements (or always move perfectly straight)?", "answer": "\nThe reality is that these images are nearly universally added in post production.\nCreating a computer environment for a film that the actors can actually interact with is much more time intensive and expensive than just creating an animation of the screen. Even if they did so, it would be time consuming to have to reset the computer screen to clear out whatever the actor did... so it's easier to just do it in post.\n\nAnother reason, which some of the other answers pointed out is that, particularly with CRT screens, the refresh rate of the screen would often be picked up on camera. This is something I remember a lot from shows in the past. It's less of an issue with modern screens but there can still be some issues. Here's an example of what it looks like, an explanation of why it exists and actually a method for getting rid of it:\n\n\n\nThe easy way to avoid this is the same method as before, use a green screen. While it's sometimes possible to change the screen refresh rate, it's not always the case and it's not always possible to set it to match your recording media.\nUnfortunately, as many computer programmers are aware, in most films and TV shows, it's pretty obvious that the person who's creating the computer environment generally knows very little about computers at all. As such, you end up with unnatural behavior like mouse movement along a straight line, and \"programming\" environments that look nothing like the reality.\nThis generally has been getting better in recent times - likely because we're becoming more and more beholden to computers and are more likely to recognize that this is an issue.\nAll that being said, other than relaxing and not paying attention, there's not much to do about it on your end. Much as the extremely straight flight lines in Indiana Jones annoy me, you have to just ignore them a bit.\nRemind yourself that movies aren't reality and that, maybe, in their reality, mouse cursors do move in a straight line. \n"}, {"question": "Why were people led to believe that the Apollo mission was fake in Interstellar?", "answer": "\nThey were led to believe the moon landing was faked in order to socially engineer the public into living a sustainable lifestyle.\nWith the Blight having devastated Earth so much that the population is believed to be around 300 million, and food a scarce commodity still, the world governments decided that the consumerist, capitalistic belief systems were not good for society. The general belief that NASA faked the moon landings, along with all the other changes that society has gone through, is used to acclimate the general public into a system of belief of survival of the group over the benefit of the individual.\nMultiple times throughout the movie we are told that this is the ideal thought process of the modern man. This is why Cooper's son is pushed towards farming. This is why Murph is ridiculed in school. This is why Professor Brand pushes Coop and Brand Jr. into Plan B through deception. Because that type of thinking moves people away from a sustainable Earth, meaning people die from lack of resources. First the teachers, spouting the propaganda of the day:\n\nIf we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...\n  ...we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.\n\nThen Brand:\n\nHe knew how hard it would be to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves.\n  Or their children.\nYou never would've come unless you believed you would save them.\n  Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.\nWe can care deeply, selflessly about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.\nHe was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species.\n\nThe entire point being that The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. I mean, the wants and desires of the few are dwarfed by the need for the species to survive.\nThe push away from technology, from the Moon Landing, was a way to engineer society into thinking about the needs of the many, instead of the wants of the individual.\nIt was to curtail individual wants and excess. That's why Tom was forced into farming, when his aptitude showed promise that society no longer encouraged in the modern crisis.\nInterestingly enough, it's the same reason NASA still exists, in secret.\nWhile it's beneficial for most of society to focus on survival, on extending the human race's existence, it's also important to look for solutions to the problem. Farming is a stop-gap, keeping humanity alive. Expanding into space is the solution, to allow humanity to THRIVE. Politics gets in the way and limits funding, but they were still funded enough to the point we see in the film. And as Brand does, people are tricked into helping because the greater good calls for them to be tricked. A person is smart.

There are two reasons for this: When the NAACP was protesting the Oompa-Loompas, they also demanded that the movie\u2019s title be changed so as not to promote the book among viewers of the movie. The second reason for shifting the main character focus was because the movie was financed by Quaker Oats, who were looking at it as a way of advertising a new line of chocolate bars that they were about to produce. Eventually, they settled on calling the new bar the Wonka Bar, and with that they chose to rename the entire movie after Willy Wonka as a promotional tie-in.

A mechanism to cope with him exploiting the groups by introducing a woman into the mix.  She is inherently, a real person in terms of the movie.\nThe Restaurant.\nProbably the most obvious reference to her reality is this scene where the waiter acknowledges both the existence of The Narrator (Jack from here on out) and Marla sitting together at the table \n\nIn that case sir may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder...\n\nThat article does reference a great counterpoint, stating that they know he is insane and compensate for it by making sure to continue Project Mayhem on their own even with a direct \"Stop\" order from him.  But I counter with a fact of how does the waiter know this is another personality, let alone female in nature?  The answer is, her physical existence.  \nThe Support Group\nHer existence is acknowledged more than most people take into consideration.  If it was really Jack approaching the group after several meetings just asking \n\nThis is cancer, right?\n\nThey would approach with more smiles and laughter on their face than surprise and disgust that a woman is joining their male support group.  Not to mention the fact that Bob would recognize \"Cornelius\" instantly. \nAlso, the other scene where they are embracing each other the proctor (leader?) of the group would have said something about Jack being alone hugging the air and hug him herself or some cheesy thing like that.  It is nigh on impossible that she would let him stand there alone (assuming Marla's non-existence) in a group that helps others cope with such strong emotions.\nThe Thrift Store\nQuick point here that if Marla is selling the clothes and she looks at Jack when Bowel Cancer is involved, why wouldn't she just look at Marla instead?\nThe Ending\nThis is also the point that the article doesn't bring up in any great detail as it drives a train through this theory.\nThe simple premise of Project Mayhem members actively tracking down Marla and bringing her to Jack is shown as the ultimate proof of her existence.  It is one thing to allow your leader to have his little insane quirks of talking to himself, contradicting himself, even fighting himself.  But to bring his actual alter ego to him is quite impossible.  Let alone finding who she is if they have seen her before and know her exact description\nLadies and gentleman of the Jury, I submit with the aforementioned evidence, that Marla Singer is REAL\n\nAn aside:\nThe book itself reveals a bit more to her existence than the movie does.\n\n Marla is a real person as it is because he sees her with a support group he decided to erase Tyler from existence in order to prevent him from ruining Marla's life further and then shoots himself when he thinks everything else is hopeless after the bomb fails.\n\nThe restaurant scene is also there but with more interaction between her and the waiter.\nI applaud the movie in that it allows one to have this theory of Marla, vs her portrayal in the book where it is much more obvious that she is a real person.\nAnother aside that struck my mind reading that article is how the house is actually a physical representation of Jack's psyche.  I disagree in the physical part because then it can be argued that anyone that joined Fight Club and later PM is just another  alternate personality of his.  I do like thinking it is more of a symbolic representation, however, which fits a lot better.\n"}, {"question": "Point of the Dothraki's attack in GoT S8E3?", "answer": "\nThe point was to demonstrate that the writers had no clue what they were doing, should probably not be allowed to write about battles again, and should not be trusted with managing \"logistical\" based plot lines...\nAnd about the best 'logical' reason to have it done would be \"To avoid paying for so many horses/GCI for the rest of the season.\"\n\nDothraki are consistently described as being the greatest light cavalry in the world, and fearsome skilled warriors: And yet they wrote them in a way to show off a skill level equal to a baby randomly clicking at the mouse while seated in front of a game of Total War.\nIf the white walker army could move too fast and too aggressively for horsemen to scout safely or to even attempt hit-and-run tactics against, then anyone who survived at the wall would not have been able to make it to Winterfell before the battle. \nFacing the front of such a large force with light cavalry could serve no useful purpose.

Think Daytona 500 vs. European rally racing.\nRadial tyres had not saturated the North American market. Bias-ply tyres (with less cornering traction) were still prevalent throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.\nElectronic traction control was non-existent. Even anti-sway bars that provided a mechanical advantage to the roll experienced in a sharp corner were considered a racing accessory.\nStunt drivers would often oversteer a vehicle causing the rear to lose traction and swing out on a corner. This \u2018fish-tail\u2019 maneuver would provide the illusion of speed. This driving exercice is not isolated to the 1970-80s; I am still amazed at how slow many chase vehicles are traveling yet still manage to skid their rear wheels out in a basic cornering maneuver then over-correct as the rear wheels swing back. At least most movies have budgets that can hire stunt drivers who can perform a controlled drift properly.\n\n"}, {"question": "Was Thanos really committed or just a hypocrite?", "answer": "\nLet us consider the plan Thanos said or at-least what I heard: \n\nHe wanted to eradicate half of everyone from every planet. \n\nNow let us consider Thanos himself... he is the last surviving Titan from the planet well Titan.

Even further still, projection houses would speed up frame rates of movies to get that one extra projection at the end of the day. It wouldn\u2019t be until 1929, with the introduction of the optical sound track, that the standard of 24 fps was established. The 24 frames per second standard was the smallest number that was easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 allowing editors to quickly find where to make their cuts; not to mention was the most cost effective.\n\nHowever, another site explains it this way:\n\nIn this Home Theater Geeks podcast, host Scott Wilkinson talks with\n  television historian Mark Schubin to find out why. The first\n  \u201cstandard\u201d framerate for filming movies was about 16 frames per\n  second, although they didn\u2019t measure it in frames per second back\n  then. The 24fps framerate basically boils down to an off-the-cuff\n  compromise, as Schubin explains.\nAccording to Schubin, movies weren\u2019t initially measured in frames per\n  second, but feet of film per minute. As an aside, this is where the\n  term \u201cfootage\u201d came from. 16fps came about because of the \u201c60 feet per\n  minute\u201d standard. Filming was done at a rate of 60 feet per minute\n  which provided around 16 frames of movie per second.\nWhile filming was done at 60 feet per minute, playback was often\n  anywhere between about 80-100 feet per minute (about 20-28 frames per\n  second). This was in order to speed up the film. It allowed the\n  theatre to be able to play more movies per day, and get more paying\n  customers through the door.\nWhen movies started to add sound, though, problems arose. The theatres\n  were still able to play at pretty much any framerate they wanted to.\n  But, 16fps movies sped up to 28fps would have actors sounding like\n  Alvin and the Chipmunks. So, a new standard must be set.\nSchubin says that an engineer from Western Electric named Stanley\n  Watkins went to meet with the Warner Brothers chief projectionist,\n  Frank Rich. Watkins asked Rich, \u201cWhat rate do people show movies at?\u201d.\n  The answer showed quite a range.\nThe major first showings of movies typically played back at around 80\n  feet per minute (around 21.5fps). The little theatres that wanted to\n  get more shows in would play back anywhere up to 100 feet per minute\n  (about 27fps). Watkins thought for a minute and said \u201cOk, let\u2019s\n  compromise on 90 [feet per minute]\u201d.\n\nThis second story seems to be supported by this blog post, which offers some more details:\n\nAnyway, someone decided it would be a great idea to add sound. How hard could it be? In fact, several companies tried to be the first to bring sound to the movies, hoping to capture the market. Funny thing is they all insisted on capturing at the same frame rate they displayed at. If you didn\u2019t, the pitch would be all wrong and everybody would sound silly. And forget about music. Some picked 80 feet per minute (the already established speed for projection), some picked 85 feet per minute, and some picked 90 feet per minute. First one to get a working system was Warner Brothers Vitaphone. It was used in the 1927 \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d which was the first feature length film with sync dialog and is considered the official start of the \u201cTalkies.\u201d\nThe Vitaphone engineers had picked 90 feet per minute, or 24fps as their capture and projection speed. If one of the others had been first, we easily could be shooting 21.33fps or 22.66fp as a standard today. So sometimes you get lucky.\n[...]\nMovietone, which used technology that put the audio as an optical track on the film had many advantages, but it was a little late out of the gate. Because Vitaphone was first, the engineers of Movietone decided to match the Vitaphone frame rate.\n\n"}, {"question": "Explanation of Jules' ending monologue", "answer": "\nThis question has already an accepted answer, but I feel the need to answer anyway, because I have a very different point of view.

Only taking Christopher Nolan's Batman into consideration then yes, he did break this rule by directly causing the fall that accidentally killed Harvey Dent. \nLet's look at the scene: \nBatman is shot, Dent is safe, and the boy's fate is undecided, but Batman can't let a coin determine that fate. He lunges at Dent and the boy and all three go over the edge. Despite his armor, Batman is injured and not at full strength. He is only able to save the boy before he himself falls after Dent. Crashing through more debris than Dent (who was pushed far enough out that he was clear (and who may have survived had he not been in such a badly burned condition)) Batman gets more injured on the way down and lands near Dent. \nLater on when talking to Gordon, Batman says:\n\n\"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things, because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I can be.\" ----- \"I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.\"\n\nIt's a great and powerful scene, but in its essence, it's one man (Batman) pushing another man (Dent) off a building and killing him (while saving an innocent boy), then taking the blame for not only Dent's death but the deaths caused by Dent as well. Batman is not just telling Gordon that he killed Dent, he is saying that he killed those people too. Batman feels directly responsible for their deaths and in Harvey's case, he is directly responsible. \nThis is the true genius of Nolan's Batman; he's not only real and plausible, he is constantly trying to figure out what he's doing, why is he doing it, and has he gone to far? Nolan made Batman break his most important rule.\n\nA lot of fans don't want to admit that Batman killed. An accidental killing doesn't count as breaking his rule they say, but to Batman it does count. It will haunt him. The deaths Two-Face caused will haunt him. He takes the blame for everything that happened. He pushed Two-Face off of a building and Two-Face died. The line has been crossed. How will Batman deal with that? How will he deal with being a criminal? The next movie will definitely deal with this but it is a huge step for Batman. \nNolan has created a realistic Batman. In Batman Begins we got to see what makes a man become a Batman. What training, what psychological problems, what Gotham's corruption had to do with it. When fighting Ra's al Ghul, we started to see a bending of the rule not to kill. Leaving Ra's al Ghul on the train was not killing in Batman's mind because Ra's al Ghul had survived a seemingly unsurvivable situation before, plus he had planned meticulously. If Batman could survive it, then he assumed Ra's al Ghul could as well. \nAt the start of The Dark Knight we start to encounter a basic problem with his rule: if Batman doesn't kill, why do criminals need to fear him? By the end of the movie Batman has killed and has taken the blame for more killings. This not only adds to the myth of the Batman but it directly affects his mental state. Throughout The Dark Knight we see him wrestling with how far he should push himself, what is his limit, what keeps him from being the Joker? \nThen he breaks his most important rule and it seems to define him more. Did he plan to kill Two-Face? No. Did he directly cause his death? Yes! He did it in the only allowable way, to protect the innocent, and he did so by accident, but he still killed and still broke his rule. \nNow we have a whole new Batman going into The Dark Knight Rises. One who has killed. One who has become a villain. Yet he is more sure of himself and what he stands for than ever before.\n"}, {"question": "What is the origin of Scooby-Doo's name?", "answer": "\nHere is a video of Fred Silverman, CBS' head of daytime programming back in 1969, discussing the creation of Scooby-Doo. Starting at about 1:40, he describes hearing \"Strangers in the Night\" while on a plane and conceiving the Scooby-Doo name on the spot:\n\nOn the plane, I couldn't sleep -- y'know, it was a Red-Eye, and I'm listening to music -- and as we're landing, as we're going in for the landing, Frank Sinatra comes on, and I hear him say \"Scooby-dooby-doo\", and it's at that point I said, \"Yeah, that's it! We'll take the dog, we'll call him Scooby-Doo, move him up front, and it'll be the dog show!\"\n\nSo this is about as authoritative as you can get: Scooby-Doo's name was inspired by the Frank Sinatra song, and not the Kinks song. As you note in the question, and as others have noted in the comments, \"scooby-dooby-doo\" may not have been the actual lyric, but having been listening to it through tinny 1960s speakers, Silverman clearly misheard it.\n\n\n\n"}, {"question": "Was a supercomputer really needed in \u201cThe Martian\u201d?", "answer": "\nThe consensus on Space Exploration.SE where this same question was asked is...\nNO\n\nAnswer by Mark Adler\nWell, developing low-thrust trajectories does take more computation than impulsive trajectories (e.g. like Voyager, which was done with rather primitive computers). You have no choice but to run many fully integrated trajectories. However it would not take a supercomputer of the future, or even a supercomputer of the present to search for and find trajectories like that.\nIn fact, Andy Weir used his home computer (whatever that was, but likely not even a small cluster) to find and check his trajectories.\n\n\n\nAnswer by DuffBeerBaron\nThe short answer is no, the calculations do not require a supercomputer. Any modern laptop has the computing power to handle the scenario.\nThe long answer is that the particular orbit depicted in the movie is what's called a Planetary Cycler, which cycles between two bodies (Earth/Mars). You can use gravity assists at each body to put your spacecraft on a return trajectory to the other body. These gravity assists can be augmented with maneuvers as needed.\n\n\nBUT YES\n\nAnswer by Loren Pechtel\nCalculating an energy-optimal orbit for a simple thing like Earth->Mars is no big deal. Even using low-thrust engines doesn't add much to it. It would be tedious but you could do it on a calculator.\nHowever, that's not what they needed in the book & movie. The objective wasn't to get there as cheap as possible, the objective was to get there as fast as possible given the available energy. There's no standard solution for this, you're simply going to have to try a huge range of possible orbits and see what's best. That's why you want a supercomputer.\nModern deep space craft often use paths that take some pretty extreme calculating. Consider Messenger: 6 planetary encounters and 5 deep space burns. They obviously simulated a huge number of possible paths to find the one that got them there the cheapest.\n\n"}, {"question": "Why did Varys remove his rings?", "answer": "\nRemoving valuable item was a sign of him knowing his coming fate.

After the commercial success of the original Star Wars, Lucas was able to continue with the multi-film epic he originally envisioned. The first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, was released in 1980 and bore the full title of \"Star Wars, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back\" in the title crawl, although it was referred to only as \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the title of its commercial release. It was the \"Episode V\" appearing in the opening crawl which originally confused those members of the audience who had not been made aware of what Lucas was explaining, that the original Star Wars was now to be understood to be the fourth part of a nine-part series. The original Star Wars was re-released in 1981 with a new title \"Star Wars, Episode IV, A New Hope\" in the title crawl. This title appeared on all subsequent re-releases and versions from then on (though the original version was released on DVD in 2006, which shows the title crawl in its original form). All subsequent Star Wars films have followed this new naming structure, although \"Star Wars\" often refers specifically to the 1977 film.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"question": "Why does \u201cNo-one ever get it in the first take\u201d?", "answer": "\nSo\u2026 why can't the actors just get it right the first time?\nWell, quite often they can. They are professionals, they do this all day, every day. They have learned how to learn lines, follow direction, and 'do the job they're paid to do'.\nOf course, no-one is going to do this first time, every time, but why can't they do it even sometimes? They know their lines, they've blocked the scene. What could possibly go wrong?\nLet's take a simple scene.\nWe have just two principals. They walk towards each other, stand face to face in conversation, then part ways. In the background there are a few indistinguishable passers-by.\nTo keep this as basic as possible for this scenario, the scene will be shot as one wide, so the audience can see the entirety of the setting, then two simple over-the-shoulder-shots, one from behind each principal looking at the other as they speak. (This is not oscar-winning stuff, I'm keeping it simple.)\nThe wide will be shot first, as this then becomes a master template for where everyone and everything was at any given moment.\nThe director takes everyone through 'blocking' first.\nThis is when the actors run through their lines, not really acting, just speaking them out loud to feel the pace. The director decides the timing and positions each needs to be in to convey their vision of the final scene.\nAt this point camera may not even be in position, nor lighting. These choices will be made simultaneously or shortly after. The director will give their indication as to how each setup will work and many other people will then be assigned their part of the task to ensure that can be realised. Camera position, lighting and everything else that will be 'seen' in each setup - props, supporting actors, 'art department' which can cover everything not covered by the above - furniture, curtains, practical lights (practicals are any light that is part of the scene itself, like a desk lamp).\nThere may come a point where all techs are asked to clear so camera can \"have a look\", before further finessing. This is the first time everyone will really be seeing the shot as it is to become.\nThe Director of Photography (DoP) will be working with camera and lighting to ensure the scene will look how the director wishes. The camera operator will be working with their two assistants (called AC - assistant camera - 1 and 2 in US parlance, Focus-puller and Clapper loader in UK, though these terms are merging these days).\nAC 1 will need measurements to each focus point for the whole scene. Camera has very accurate measuring these days, just like your own consumer camera or phone, but no self-respecting AC1 will ever rely on that;) AC1 uses a remote control focussing device with measured rings which they can mark with distances. They watch via a dedicated portable monitor on a stand, just for them. For a long walk into shot, they will get one of the second team (stand-in) to walk the route and will physically measure, with a good old-fashioned reel of cloth tape, and mark points on the ground down the route.\nPrincipals by now will have likely finished blocking and will have been stepped off. The second team will be in place now, whilst the techs are doing all this measurement, checking how the lighting looks on camera and making adjustments.\nOnce this is just about all ready to go, then the 3rd Assistant Director (3rd AD) and their assistants (all confusingly called \"thirds\") will bring in the supporting artists ('extras') and place them; give them moves to be timed either against dialog if it can be heard from there, or by counting off seconds (called 'beats' but you can consider them seconds) mentally if not.\nSo, everyone is just about in place.\nThe principals are called back to set and the second team goes to watch playback on the monitors in the \"video village\". Stand ins (2nd team) need to be able to see the scene unfold in case any large changes are to be made and they are called back to set. They need to know what, if anything, has changed since they were last on.\nWe're ready for a rehearsal take.\nCamera goes up (\"Lights, camera, action\" - no-one ever says this, but the precursor to a take is a topic all of its own) and the scene is run.\nThe director or DoP may need to make changes, big or small, then a second rehearsal take, rarely a third\u2026 and then, after no more than a couple of hours since we all walked onto set - we're ready for a take!!\nThe first AD shouts \"final checks\" and 20 more people rush in, making sure everyone's hair is exactly right, costume, people are holding the right props, etc. When everyone is happy, off they all scurry again, and now we're ready to go.\n\"Going for a take\u2026 Lights, camera, action\"\nEverybody knows what they're doing, where to be, the lights are up, camera is happy.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\nWell\u2026 everything and anything.\nThe director has to get this right.\nNow everything has settled down, we're really starting to see the true direction the scene is taking; how it shapes, how the actors' positions and camera focus affect the feel of the shot.\n\"Can we just move your mark forwards a couple of inches?\"\nAC1 has to run in to move a little T-shape of gaffa tape on the floor so the principal knows where to stand next time.\n\"I don't like how that SA crosses picture just on the vital line.\"\nIt's communicated to the 3rd AD that the passer's timing needs adjusting, or that they take a different route.\n\"It's a bit bright just over there.\"\nThe DoP and lighting gaffer arrange to have a light moved, or a flag dropped in to shade it a bit.\n\"Could we just pace up the pan as [actor] walks in, so we arrive before he does?\"\nCamera op makes a mental note and shows the move to the director a couple of times.\n\"I think we should pull focus just on that line so Actor B is sharp instead of actor A\"\nAC2 makes some more measurements.

They're going to save the truly emotional drain the scene might have for their own close-up. That's the one that matters in the end.\nWe spent maybe two or more hours (my record is 5 hours, from crew call to first roll, with Tim Burton) getting far enough into the process to even go for the first take. Why would anyone stop right there?\nMany of these decisions are artistic not technical. The director needs to always remain aware that the final shape of the movie may not be as initially intended, so some leeway in interpretation may be required. Take 1 might just be the one they use in the final cut, but so much time has been invested getting to take 1 that multiple takes make sense, even if there are no technical issues, only artistic.\nThat's why no-one ever gets it in the first take.\n"}, {"question": "Why is James Bond less tech savvy in the Daniel Craig movies?", "answer": "\nI don't think it had any plot driven change.

He's their chosen leader. It doesn't really matter if he orders the execution as Lord Commander or conqueror, the result is the same. The rules are as irrelevant at this moment as the fact King Robert wasn't the next in line to the throne when he put himself on it. Varys put it rather well:\n\nPower resides where men believe it resides\n\nAlliser could have protested against this, but chooses not to because he still sees Jon as the Lord Commander, and accepts his defeat. From a transcript:\n\nAlliser: I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night's Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of murderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again.\nJon: I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser. \nAlliser: I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever.\n\nAlliser is very absolute and black-and-white, not the type to quibble about interpretations. He'd probably rather hang than try to get off on a technicality.\nAs head steward, Bowen Marsh (the first of the four) would be the most likely to raise a technical objection - but strict conformity to the rules is clearly not his focus at this moment:\n\nYou... you shouldn't be alive. It's not right.\n\nHe's a bit too distracted by the whole \"the man I murdered is back from the dead\" thing to worry about whether the man he murdered is, technically speaking, overstepping his authority. It'd take a ballsy lawyer to say \"You lost the authority to execute me when I murdered you!\".\n\n\nFor Jon...\n...it's hard to say whether this would bother him. He's always been someone torn between doing what the rules or honour say (e.g. not joining Robb's army), bending honour to do what he thinks is right (e.g. trying to assassinate Mance during negotiations), and just doing what he wants to do (e.g. Ygritte). \nBut we've got reason to expect undead Jon to be colder and harder than he was before, based on what Beric said about his own returns from the dead back in season 3:\n\nEvery time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away.\n\nAlso, in the books:\n\n It seems like the longer someone is dead, the colder they come back. A certain lady who was dead a rather long time, who had been rather compassionate, comes back distinctly stone-hearted... Beric was never dead longer than minutes I believe, this lady was dead for days; it stands to reason Jon would be somewhere between the two.\n\nJon was never entirely above bending the rules when it suited him, and a potentially vengeful undead Jon would seem to be even less likely to worry about such details. \nThe way he walks straight out with only the slimmest of attempts to justify himself...\n\nMy watch is ended\n\n...is a pretty good indication that he worries less about such details. As is one of the very first things he says after coming back:\n\nI did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it.\n\n\nUpdate from episode 4:\nRegarding Jon's status at the Wall:\n\n It's confirmed that there's disagreement and confusion about whether Jon is Lord Commander or not: a Brother delivers him a letter, addressing him as Lord Commander, and he hesitates, denies the title, but takes it anyway. There's also debate about whether his vows still apply.\n\nRegarding Jon 2.0's personality compared to the original model:\n\n Based on his conversation with Sansa, he seems to be more lost than vengeful, compared to his old self: possibly less purposeful and driven, rather than more. It certainly seems like he came back \"a bit less\", but not in the cold, grim, hard and wrathful way I had suspected based on the analogous character from the books.\n\n"}, {"question": "How does one identify Valyrian steel?", "answer": "\nAccording to the Game of Thrones Wiki page about Valyrian steel:\n\nValyrian steel is recognizable from its sharpness, as well as a distinctive rippled pattern visible in blades made from it\n\nWhile it's hard to detect sharpness from eyesight alone, the \"distinctive rippled pattern\" can be detected easily by those who know where to look for it.\nCouple of examples where it's easy to spot such patterns:\n\n\n"}, {"question": "How was the deserted London scene in the movie '28 Days Later' filmed?", "answer": "\nNormally, movie producers would obtain permits to shut down roads around city filming locations. However, this is not usually permitted in London (even huge productions like Bond get very limited privileges in London), unlike a lot of America cities. Although, it seems that the producers were able to get some road closures, but under very limited conditions.\nTo get around this, the empty London scenes were shot very early in the morning - sunrise in London is about 5am in the summer, and there is a long dusk before true sunrise which gives a decent amount of light. In fact, the dusk light (the golden light you see in some of the stills you posted) was probably used to provide an additional sense of eeriness to some scenes, along with some filtering/grading to reduce its effect in others.\n\nBefore we started the main shoot we took a week in July, beginning each day at three or four every morning and would wait for the sun to come up\nWe were able to shoot for an hour or so before the city got too busy for us to hold back the traffic. It was very exciting, and when you see the whole of Westminster Bridge and the embankment all closed for you, and the traffic stopped, and you can't hear anything, it was thrilling but strange as well.\n\nSource: 28 Days Later : About The Shoot\nA lot of the scenes are filmed in the inner cities of Westminster and London (the City of London itself is a square mile in the middle of Greater London), and these are mostly commercial and government offices - not a lot of residential areas - so there was not a huge number of people waking up and heading to work.\nHowever, even in the wee hours of the morning, Westminster and London and the surrounding areas are not completely empty. I think if you look carefully there is at least one brief shot of a moving bus in the distance. Mostly, the crew would reset and try for another shot if something like that happened.\nI remember reading around the time of the movie coming out, that a bigger problem were drunken revellers spilling out of nearby bars and clubs - the production crew hired a number of attractive young women to distract and guide people around the shoot.\n"}, {"question": "Was the original \u201cPink Panther\u201d movie intended to be a comedy?", "answer": "\nFrom NNDB:\n\nEdwards' most famous work, The Pink Panther, was released in 1963, with Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The part had originally been cast with Peter Ustinov, but that actor reneged at the last minute, and Sellers stepped in, with his suggestion that the character be \"bumbling\", which, of course, changed not just the character, but the nature of film comedy.\n\nAnd from a Review by Clarenc Beaks:\n\nThe Pink Panther (1963) began life as a star-studded caper comedy intended to be anchored by David Niven as the debonair jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton, aka \"The Phantom,\" a man audacious enough to carry on an affair with the wife of his tireless, if thoroughly inept, pursuer, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. And had Peter Ustinov, originally cast as Clouseau (and, coincidentally, batman to the higher-ranking Niven in World War II), not backed out of the production, following Ava Gardner's lead (who had been cast as Clouseau's philandering spouse), it's entirely possible that there would have been no Pink Panther franchise (though a great thespian, Ustinov was hardly anyone's idea of an explosive comedic talent). But when Peter Sellers came on board as the incompetent inspector, the picture was suddenly given a raucously funny performer who easily could run away with the proceedings.\n\nSo it seems it was intended to be a comedy from the beginning, but quite a different style of comedy than what it became once Sellers got involved.\n"}, {"question": "Why do studios use Roman numerals in the copyright notice in the end credits?", "answer": "\nAccording to David Feldman's book Imponderables: The Solution to the Mysteries of Everyday Life:\n\nWhy are copyrighted dates on movies and television shows written in Roman numerals? \n\nThe general consensus is the \"deception theory\": \n\nto \"make it difficult for viewers to determine exactly how old the show is\", the reason being the older the date the \"staler\" the material may seem to the audience.\n  \n\nThen there's the \"inertia theory\": \n\nThat's just the way it's always been done.\n\n\n\n\nThis BBC article says something similar:\n\nPerhaps one of the most notable areas where people are likely to come across Roman numerals is in TV and film credits, where the convention is not to spell out what year something was made.\nThe practice is believed to have started in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes.

The (artistic) tragic part to this is that, if Leonidas had thrown a slight bit softer, the spear would have plunged a few inches lower, and the throw would have gotten Xerxes in the chest (and probably kill him). And so Leonidas dies having missed because he \u201ctried too hard\u201d to get distance on his throw.\nThe following clip explains why Leonidas knelt (to shed his equipment in a passive manner) as preparation to make a difficult spear shot.\n\n\n\n"}, {"question": "Why were sloths chosen to depict DMV workers?", "answer": "\nOne reason the scene works so well on repeated viewings is that it's essentially a sketch.

But Jon, their leader, is still alive, and Ramsay's talking, not posing an immediate physical threat - so they wait for Jon's order.\nThis gives Ramsay an opportunity to do what he does best: manipulate honourable fools, and exploit emotional weaknesses. \nHe challenges Jon to a one-to-one fight, a challenge no sane person would ever accept in these circumstances - but Jon is easy to manipulate and enraged from just having seen a big friendly giant get shot in the eye. Jon charges, seemingly accepting the duel. Jon's men don't know what to do. This is duel, right? You don't interfere with duels. \nIf Ramsay had succeeded in shooting Jon here, Ramsay would get another opportunity to manipulate.

While acting can be a satisfying endeavor, the true artistic vision of a story comes from a director.  There is also a degree of control over that final vision that no other role has.  Many of those involved in acting want to either take a turn at, or, ultimately become directors.\nRobert Redford and Clint Eastwood are actors who have achieved as much acclaim for their directing as their acting, and both them are considered huge just for their acting.\nChris Evans, known for \"Captain America,\" doesn't even like the life of an actor/star, as much, and even though he's young and, probably, at his peak of star power and earning potential, he's publicly stated his intention to leave acting (for the most part), preferably to direct, instead.\nVariety: Captain America's Chris Evans Ready To Leave Acting Behind\nWhy do it on TV shows?  \n\nBecause many of the shows use a variety of directors for different episodes, so there's more opportunity there for an actor to try it out with small budgets at stake.\nBecause of the smaller scale, it's a way for actors to get that initial experience, with the support of proven and experienced professionals they know and trust. There's probably also an established framework or structure the show has for the less experienced director to work within, making the scope of the endeavor less challenging as a starting point (thanks to jpmc26 for pointing this out in comments).\nMany of the actors, their habits, philosophies, etc. are known to the show's producers and studios because they've been working there, so it's an easier sell for the actor to be given that chance.\nBecause of their status, many actors have more leverage for that specific show than they would for a completely original project, and because of the lesser impact because of point #1, it's probably a fairly simple way to keep those stars happier.\nAs actors stay with a show for longer periods of time, they will invariably get more input to how characters are shaped and story lines are developed.  Allowing a hand in directing an episode seems like a natural extension of that growth.\n\n"}, {"question": "What is the main theme of The Dark Knight?", "answer": "\nThe Dark Knight, in my view, is an epic description of the Joker's character.

I observed a similarity and a difference between the Joker and the other mob bosses/bad guys.\nThe similarity is that, both the bad guys and Joker have anti-social ideas. The difference lies in what level of sophistication the players employ. The other guys want to kill Batman and prey on the fearful. Joker is different. He just wants to kill everyone else. He also wants to prove that everyone is inherently un-altruistic / sadistic. That is why he conducts the experiment on the ferry with the prisoners and the convicts. This is classic prisoners' dilemma.\nHe also succeeds in employing Harvey Dent, the supposed hope of Gotham City, the only DA brave enough to prosecute Gotham's criminals, and turn him against Gotham.

The delay between the two explosions was deliberate, this was to allow Heath Ledger to be much closer to the building.\n\nThe debris that you see flying around is actually pieces of soft cork, fired out of metal drums. The flying glass is stunt glass / breakaway glass, with each window shattered individually with its own charge.\n\n\nThe Focus Point doesn't explicitly say whether or not fiddling with the remote was Heath Ledger's idea. It does say:\n\nWe rehearsed endlessly with Heath that morning. We walked him out, got him to do exactly what he was going to do, Chris Corbould [special effects supervisor] calling the explosions, where they would take place. We rehearsed it, I think, about twelve times.\n\nSo if Heath Ledger did improvise with the remote, it sounds like he did it in rehearsal rather than on the spot with things exploding all around him.\n"}, {"question": "Why do people call Morgan Freeman's character Red?", "answer": "\nWell, it is kinda explained on The Daily Beast,\n\nIn the book, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding was a ginger-haired, middle-aged Mick. Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were all considered for the role that went to Morgan Freeman.

And for non-native speakers, \"ginger-haired\" means \"red-haired\".\nCredits to @G&C, \"red-haired\" is used to describe orange hair colours because orange is (relatively speaking) the newest colour name in the 7-colour spectrum (besides indigo), so the term \"red-hair\" literally precedes the use of \"orange\" as a colour.\n"}, {"question": "Does Mia mistake Vincent's heroin for cocaine because it's in a baggie rather than a balloon?", "answer": "\nYes, what Vince buys is absolutely heroin.

Yes, you can snort heroin.  In small amounts.\nVince, if you recall, asked for the high-grade stuff.  Unless you have specific tools at your disposal (like a microscope or a burner), it's very difficult to tell high-grade heroin and cocaine apart.  So, usually, you put heroin in a balloon and coke in a bag.  Most drug users will know the distinction.  However, if it's not your stash it's always best to ask or do a small taste test, because they have distinctive tastes.

If someone's taking a photo or video of you, you're \"trained\" to look at the camera because it's generally a portrait-style shot.\nActors are trained to not look at the camera. Looking at the camera is called \"spiking the camera\" and it means that you've just ruined a shot and you have to start over... congrats, you just cost the company money. As the TV Tropes article points out, editors don't always catch these, so you may see them in films and TV:\n\nA specific form of Breaking the Fourth Wall accomplished merely by looking directly at the camera. Usually done by accident, by amateur actors who happen to notice a camera is pointed at them. The trouble here is that the editor didn't catch it, allowing the character to make eye contact with the audience. Typically a film or live TV trope, especially in dramas. \n\nTrust me, even for new extras, you've had \"don't look at the camera\" so drummed into your head from the second you set foot on set, it's running non-stop through your mind that it's the only thing you're thinking about.\nOn set, directors will give actors a specific eye-line for where to look. Usually they're looking at another actor... the person they're doing the scene with. This is beneficial for performance reasons. If the person they're acting opposite isn't available due to scheduling or they're in  makeup, or something else, they often have someone else there to deliver lines and act as eye line.\nSometimes they're looking at a thing off in the distance... building, animal, ocean... whatever. Sometimes they're looking at a piece of colorful tape that's stuck to part of the camera or other piece of equipment (this is generally used when the talent is almost looking at camera)... And, in CG films, they're probably looking at a colorful tennis ball on a stick being controlled by someone off camera.\n\nAnd, finally... and probably most importantly...  if you're good at acting, you're so involved in what you're doing that everything other than the person/people you're acting opposite simply fade away into the background.

Buffalo Bill inserts a moth's cocoon to the mouth of one of his female victims. Moths represent change in the movie, and other than explicitly representing Buffalo Bill's desire to change, it could certainly be argued that Clarice also transforms during the investigation.\nThe skull on the moth actually replicates In Voluptas Mors [Warning: Nudity], a photo conceived by Salvador Dali of seven naked women[*] that form a skull. This not only suggests the lewd nature of the crimes seen in the movie, which involve female bodies, but also the complexity involved (Lecter is an extremely cultured man and a skilled painter).\nThe moth also covers Clarice's mouth to allude to that titular Silence she so desperately needs.\n\n[*] [As a point of interest: Before the plot starts in both book and movie, Buffalo Bill as a serial killer (since he's responsible for other, unrelated murders) had already kidnapped 5 women, skinned them and dumped their naked bodies in rivers.

He said that in the world he's showing, and which, to his knowledge, existed, there are two kind of veterans of the Vietnam War. One that are aware of things they have done and are ashamed and hide the fact they were abroad. And one that are raised in this very American culture of being proud for serving your country because it can't be wrong. And this is what troubles Rambo. He has, what we would call, cognitive dissonance. He can't understand how people think his involvement was wrong and bad when he did what he did for his country AND for the citizens of his country. In his book Rambo dies as a sign that everything that was wrong with the Vietnam War and that what it did to people (US and Vietnamese alike) should die too.\n"}, {"question": "Why is it so easy to become king of Wakanda?", "answer": "\nIt's not THAT easy.  But the process is their tradition.  Remember, the ruler of Wakanda is also given the powers of the Black Panther and is expected to protect the country from outsiders etc - so combat skills are definitely a requirement.\nHowever, when a King dies, the King's first born takes over - much like in any monarchy.  The big difference here to most monarchies is that they invite open challenges from the tribes that make up Wakanda's people.  Each tribe has to nominate a challenger if they wish to challenge for the throne.  None of the tribes wishes to challenge T'Challa's claim except for M'Baku of the Jabari tribe.\nKillmonger has the ability to challenge for the throne because he is \"of royal blood\" - he's the son of T'Challa's uncle, who was King T'Chaka's brother.  If he wasn't of royal blood, then his challenge couldn't be accepted and would be deemed invalid.\nConor McGregor couldn't take a shot at it as he's not Wakandan, so he couldn't be nominated by a tribe, and unless he could prove some royal connection to T'Challa, he's an invalid challenge as well.\n"}, {"question": "If Agent Smith is just an AI program, then how could he end up in the real world?", "answer": "\nIf you think our brain as just a CPU, and memory storage, you'd think of yourself as your memories + your thinking capacity.

The Library of Congress estimates that 75% of all silent films are lost. Overall, 50% of American sound films made before 1950 are considered lost films. (film preservation)\nFilms may go missing for a variety of reasons. The big culprit is the use of nitrate film until the early 1950s. Nitrate films are highly flammable, and will decay into a powder or sticky goo that can spontaneously combust in the storage-shed conditions they were commonly stored. A fire destroyed the entire vault of pre-1935 negatives at Fox Pictures, and a fire in 1967 decimated MGM's early content. Kodak introduced a nonflammable film in 1909, but chemicals used to keep it pliable evaporated too quickly, making the film dry and brittle.\nUntil the preservationist movement fully kicked in, as much as half the 400,000 short sponsored films made in the US were lost, often thought of as simply disposable, or older versions were disposed of once upgraded. These are typically films made for educational, training, or religious purposes that were popular from the '40s through the 1970s. Many silent films were also simply discarded as \"useless\" once talkies took over entirely.\nMost mainstream movies from the 1950s through today survive due to increased preservation efforts and more stable media, but even today films are lost.\nRecent Losses\nSome of Jackie Chan's and Sammo Hung's first roles, including Big and Little Wong Tin Bar, have been considered lost. Ed Wood's 1972 film, The Undergraduate, has been lost along with his 1970 film, Take It Out In Trade, which exists only in fragments without sound. Most of Andy Milligan's early films made between 1965 and 1988 are considered lost. Many adult films and low-budget B-Movies go unnoticed until the participants become notable, then many of their early works are simply gone.\nLost films are anything in which no part of a print is known to have survived.

So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.\"\nBut later Cole decides to stay in 1995, and by the airport scene, he has given the future scientists the slip by cutting out his teeth. Except Cole leaves a message from the airport, leading the future scientists back to him -- with a two-part plan:\n\nCole's message did not identify the virus spreader, so Jose's task at airport is to give Cole the gun and then watch who Cole goes after. When Catherine runs up and says she's figured out it is the redhead assistant to Dr Goynes who spreads the virus, Jose fades out of the scene, having got what he needed.

To prevent the disruption, the lady scientist is sent as back-up who -- if Cole somehow manages to stop redhead-ponytail guy -- can grab the briefcase, take the flights, and make sure the virus still gets spread around the world (which seems to end up being unnecessary because redhead-ponytail gets on plane OK)\n\nLuckily for the scientists, airport security shoots Cole when Cole tries to shoot the redhead guy. (The scientists may have provided Cole a non-working gun to encourage this outcome.)\nMore evidence:\n\nthe lady scientist says insurance remark on the plane seated next\nto redhead-ponytail guy, suggesting she was prepared to go to the\nsame destinations, which the scientists had Cole list earlier in the movie\nthe scientists may have been worried because Pitt's father changing security procedures, showing Cole could indeed disrupt timeline.\nat one point, a scientist in the future scornfully calls the pre-virus world \"that dying world\" suggesting no interest in saving it.\nthe overall story of the movie is Cole wants to live in the past despite being ordered not to (Cole: \"This part isn't about the virus, is it?

It was the scene with Peeves the Poltergeist. We shot it in Gloucester Cathedral cloisters.\nSadly it never made it to the final take although I hear Chris Columbus is going to be making a director's cut in which it will be reinstated.\n\nThis would have been Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and he was played by Rik Mayall. I\u2019m not aware of that director\u2019s cut being released, or any of that footage being widely available.\nSo why were those scenes cut?

If they were trying to shed material, you can see why Peeves would be one of the characters who gets cut.\nAlternatively, there\u2019s also an interview with Steve Kloves, who wrote all but one of the films, who offers his take on why Peeves was dropped in the final cut:\n\nOn a different note, what about some characters in the books who never appeared on screen? What ever happened to Peeves?\nPeeves was always an issue. Chris Columbus was determined to put him in the first movie. I think there were even some technological problems with him initially, and [not] being satisfied with how he looked. He was always a bit tangential. I think [Argus] Filch, in a way, became that energy in the movies. And he was actually sort of beloved at a certain point, Filch. So I think to have Peeves, it would have felt like we were doubling up on that. It's not exactly the same but it's a bit like that.

By Friday evening,\nthe two accountants will know all the winners.\n\u2022 Though they won\u2019t\ndisclose how many vote are received, there are about 6,000 voting\nmembers of the Academy. All of the counting is done by hand. \u201cIt\u2019s\nold-school,\u201d says Cullinan. \u201cIt\u2019s as boring as it sounds. You have\nlots and lots of stacks of little pieces of paper.\u201d\n\u2022 All of the\ncategories are counted several times, and extra if there\u2019s a tie\n(which has happened).

They carry the briefcases down the red\ncarpet, pausing for interviews, and each take their places on opposite\nsides of the stage. As presenters come on from either side, they\u2019ll be\nhanded the right cards.\n\nThis process is backed up in several other places, including the Journal of Accountancy:\n\nSecrecy is paramount. Team members from PwC meet at an undisclosed\nlocation, and each accountant tabulates only a portion of the votes so\nhe or she won\u2019t know the final results. Only Ruiz and Cullinan put\neverything together in the end to determine who the Oscar winners are,\nand they commit those results to memory. The winners\u2019 names are not\ntyped into a computer or written down, to avoid potential lost slips\nof paper or breaches of security.\nIn the final hours before the Oscars\nceremony, Ruiz and Cullinan will quiz each other to make sure they\nhave accurately memorized the winners in each category. They then will\nlook through the preprinted cards for all of the nominees, select\nthose that list each of the victors, and stuff the envelopes. Both\nwill head to the ceremony on Sunday carrying the correct set of\nenvelopes. If one gets hung up in L.A. traffic, the other will also\nhave the results in his or her briefcase. Once at the event, both will\nbe backstage to hand the appropriate envelopes to the celebrity\npresenters during the live event.\n\nSo inferring from what both of these articles say, the orchestra find out when most of the world finds out - when the winner is announced.

The Aaron from the future has recorded all earlier conversations, travelled back in time, replaced his earlier self and tries to recreate the dialogues this way, sometimes failing (e.g. in the basketball scene, where he misses the throw).

Was it seen as a joke? An eccentricity of Doc Brown? A symbol of luxury or frivolity or stupidity?\n\nThe DeLorean fits with Doc Brown, thematically speaking. Everything you say about the car:\n\nNotorious for poor quality, being badly made, and a huge expensive flop\n\napplies to Emmett Brown as well, barring the success of the time machine which is irrelevant as he would obviously already have bought the car by then.\nMuch as the DeLorean was a ridiculed failed futuristic car built by a now-disgraced designer, Doc Emmett Brown was a disgraced nuclear physicist and perceived to be mad as a coot. He spent his family fortune on his failed inventions, losing tons of money in the process (there's the reasonable fan theory that he burned his own manor to collect insurance. The fire is mentioned in a newspaper article in the movie). It's not that surprising based on his general demeanor, but people dismissed him as a crazy old man.\nIt's very fitting for Doc to choose this car which (like its creator) had spectacularly failed and was the laughing stock of those who knew it.\nThis is a fairly common trope: a character chooses the option that describes themselves well. When buying a pet, a social outcast will pick a lonely animal. When buying a car, the crazy failed inventor picks a crazy failed car. It's an easy way to provide both exposition (if the character isn't well known yet) and thematic congruence (if the audience already knows that both are similar).\nBreaking Bad is a great second example here. Walt's car, much like himself, is a boring and bland car, and even though it's perfectly capable and has no glaring issues, it just completely failed to take off in the modern market, underselling even relative to cars with less features and worse reviews. Sound familiar?\n\nI suspect you know most of this already, but I'm adding it because the conclusion relies on it.\nIn regards to the car itself: did the first BTTF change the perception of the DeLorean?\nSadly, DMC had already gone out of business by then. On top of that, a cocaine scandal left the DeLorean's creator (and thus legacy of the DeLorean itself) heavily tainted.\n\nOn October 19, 1982, the same day DeLorean's factory was announced to be closed, the man behind the car was arrested in a cocaine trafficking bust. He had been set up by his neighbor, an FBI informant, and was caught at an LA hotel saying \"it's better than gold\" after being given a large case of cocaine by the undercover FBI agents.\n\n\nHe was acquitted in August 1984, successfully claiming governmental entrapment, but the damage to his reputation and finances had been done.\n\nThere were no more cars to sell, so there wasn't much to gain for the movie. However, there is some silver lining here:\n\nThanks to the film, the DeLorean was elevated to icon-status, with licensing for toy cars reportedly paying DeLorean's bills.\n\n\nIn conclusion:\nSo it would be fair to separate the conclusion in two parts: the car itself had already irreversibly failed, but it found a second life as a pop movie icon, and it still is to this day. Due to the similarities between Doc Emmett Brown and the DeLorean (as perceived in 1984), the car fit with the movie thematically, both in reputation (for Doc's character) and looks (for a sci-fi movie).\nYou can argue that for most people, the real car and the movie icon had little to no overlap for them.\n"}, {"question": "Is Batman Begins based on any Batman comic or was it entirely written from scratch?", "answer": "\nBatman Begins is a combination of stories from the Batman mythos, as well as an original story.

It remains to be seen if the Ra's in the movie makes a similar comeback or not).\nThe film The Dark Knight uses elements from the story The Long Halloween, though again the story is mainly an original story. It was also related that Heath Ledger, who played The Joker, locked himself in his hotel room for weeks to try and get to the core of the character of The Joker, even writing a journal of The Joker's 'thoughts'. \n"}, {"question": "Why does Westley say Rodents of Unusual Size don't exist?", "answer": "\nHe says this to keep the Princess calm and moving forward -- which is their best chance of surviving. He is concerned she might do something irrational like go back or take off in some random direction. He knows that just maybe they will be left alone, and his ploy will succeed. If not, then he has no control over it anyway, and will have to deal with it at that time. \nHe has also grown into his role as the Dread Pirate. He pulls that role off because it suits him naturally. What would the pirate do? He would down play it and essentially write if off as something to not be concerned about.\nAlso, it makes for good comedy. He says they don't exist, and then he is wrestling with one of them. I remember heartily laughing at this one.\n"}, {"question": "How does a rifle fire backwards?", "answer": "\nWhile I am not a gun expert, it would be safe to say that while normal rifle cannot be modified to shoot bullet backward, it is possible to modify the rifle to make it hurt the shooter.

We know that Marty quite literally hooked the line at precisely the correct time. Therefore the only valid conclusion is that Marty accelerated faster than Doc calculated/anticipated/intended.\nThus there are only two valid explanations:\n(1) Doc planned for Marty to accelerate at a rate less than the car's maximum acceleration. This leads to the obvious question: How would Marty know how fast to accelerate? We can suppose that he did some test runs off screen, or we can attribute it to movie magic (\"he eyeballed it!\").\n(2) Doc miscalculated the maximum acceleration of the car. Although a genius, perhaps there were aspects of the car that he had no way of determining in advance. Or maybe there was less fuel in the tank (less mass to push) or better road traction than he anticipated (although the roads seemed pretty slick, IMO). Either way, if he did make a mistake and the timer was set to assume maximum acceleration, then Marty was very lucky.\nThere is a third option (Marty was always supposed to wait X number of seconds after the timer went off), but that isn't directly supported by anything canonical in the movie.\nOther thoughts:\nThe flexibility of the hooking mechanism or any other such variance in exactly when Marty hit the cable is negligible. He clearly left the starting line many seconds late. Any question about whether the flexibility of the hooking mechanism impacted his arrival time would only have an impact on the order of milliseconds and may thus be discounted for the purpose of this question.\nThe speed of the lightning through the cable is obviously shown to be quite slow for visual impact in the movie. Obviously in real life it would have traveled faster than that. In any event, Doc would have been able to calculate the speed of the lightning through the conductor, so let's assume he was accurate there.\nUnfortunately any discussion surround whether the lighting struck at \"precisely\" 10:04:00 or sometime between 10:04:01 and 10:04:59 is a red herring. The fact is that the movie depicts the lightning as striking immediately after the minute hand moves to 10:04. It's not made clear in the movie how 1955 Doc knows that it will be \"precisely\" 10:04:00. (My guess: clock engineers in the intervening years investigated the clock, observed that it was \"precisely\" 10:04:00, and then documented that fact in the flyer that Marty received. But exactly how that information came to Doc is beyond the scope of the question the OP asked.) Regardless, 1955 Doc is correct -- lightning did strike at precisely that time.\n"}, {"question": "How do actors make eye contact with CGI characters?", "answer": "\nIf you talk to actors that do a lot of CGI, the answer is \"not very easily\". (Ian McKellan famously almost quit filming The Hobbit because most of his work was acting solo, since they had to CGI in the hobbits later to make them short.)\nHowever, there's a couple of techniques that pop up frequently in CGI-heavy movies:\n\nThe \"tennis ball\". Often an actual tennis ball, but not always. Some small prop will be held at what would be eye-level for a CGI character, and the actors play to that. Because the CGI is added in later, the FX team will just adjust their graphics so that the character shows up where the actor is actually looking, as much as they can. This technique is also used when actors need to maniuplate (touch, hold, pet, etc) CGI creatures, to give them something tangible to work with.\n\nStand-ins. For CGI characters that are mostly human-sized and human-shaped, often times the actor doing the motion-capture will just act through the scenes (dressed in a motion-capture suit) and be digitally replaced later on with their character. This was done in your example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with live actors playing the turtles (click this still image for the video):\n\nSometimes they will combine the two techniques. In Age of Ultron for example, James Spader in motion capture gear plays Ultron throughout the movie, but early on the character becomes much bigger than a human. For those scenes, they positioned a set of red lights over Spader's head so the actors (in this scene, it's Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) would remember to look well above Spader's head when talking to Ultron (again, click for video):\n\n\n"}, {"question": "Why does Obi-Wan say that he'll become more powerful if Vader kills him?", "answer": "\nHe is referring to the fact that he will become one with The Force - a technique only a handful of jedi have learned. \nAs a 'spirit' he will continue to guide Luke, and thus become somewhat omniscient - subsequently becoming more powerful.\nYou might say as an older man, he had become physically weak, but once bonded with the Force he becomes greater than the sum of his parts.\n"}, {"question": "How does Captain America know about Iron Man's parents' fate?", "answer": "\nYou have to refer to Captain America: Winter Soldier movie for that.

When the monkey's cage, which contained oxygen, was opened the animal was rendered unconscious by the CO2.

The concept is usually attributed to the philosopher, critic and dramatist Denis Diderot. The term itself was used by Moli\u00e8re. The fourth wall illusion is often associated with naturalist theatre of the mid 19th-century, and especially with the innovations of the French director Andr\u00e9 Antoine.\nThe restrictions of the fourth wall were challenged in 20th-century theatre.

Having already experienced a failed attempt at information theft (when Cobb and co tried to steal information from him), Saito wanted to put every little thing into his favor, and the best way to do that was to be present at every step.\nA good example of this is during the planning phase:\n\nARTHUR\nOn a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody\n  walks through the cabin.

From The Killing Joke:\n\nYou see it doesn't matter if you catch me and send me back to the asylum... [...] I've proved my point. I've demonstrated there's no difference between me and everyone else! All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day. You had a bad day once, am I right? I know I am. I can tell. You had a bad day and everything changed. Why else would you dress up as a flying rat? You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else... [...] Something like that happened to me, you know. [...] My point is, I went crazy. When I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot!\n\nYou can see this philosophy behind so much of what the Joker does throughout the movie, notice how many of his crimes involve getting relatively innocent people to commit atrocities. He does whatever he can to give them that one bad day that will push them over the edge.\nWhile Batman's sufferings have definitely left him alienated from the regular populace (stranger), they've also made him the man he is (stronger). The Joker's goal is just to corrupt people, to leave them as twisted and messed up as he is. This is particularly evident with Harvey Dent to whom the Joker gives personal attention. You can see his glee in corrupting Gotham's \"White Knight\".\nBasically, while the Joker has no problem with killing people, he loves it when he can make them as strange as he is. Most of his plans are set up so that one way or another, he'll get an outcome that makes him happy.\n"}, {"question": "Why do movie teams shoot alternate endings?", "answer": "\nThere is a wide variety of reasons as to why a movie might have alternate endings.\n\nThe original ending tested poorly during screen tests:\nIn this case the director had a specific ending that made it through production, but was received negatively by test audiences, forcing the studio to re-shoot the ending to better please the target audiences.\nAn example of this is DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) which originally had Average Joes losing at the end. (Discussed here)\nThe script wasn't completed when the endings were shot:\nin this case the details of the script are still being worked on, so the crew shoots multiple endings with the hope that one will eventually be used as the final, official ending.\nThe original ending was seen as too graphic or violent especially studio is trying to hit a specific rating (usually PG-13 instead of R), so the ending will be slightly edited:\nAn example of this was Thelma and Louise (1991) (discussed here).\n\nOnly a tiny tweak here, but a fairly significant one \u2014 the first ending showed Thelma and Louise's car tumbling all the way to the canyon floor, no doubt getting pulverized in the process. Harvey Keitel's character finds the Polaroid that blew out of the car and looks at it as a helicopter heads down into the Grand Canyon to survey the wreckage. As you probably know, the updated ending is a wee bit more hopeful \u2014 we see their car drive off the cliff, but not the aftermath.\n\nThe studio or the director specifically wants multiple endings: the only example I can think of for this is Clue (1985) where the movie was shot with three different endings, each one would be randomly selected during each showing.

It was a very depressing afternoon. [Laughs] I remember being struck by the fragility of life here. Everyone who has grown up in the West and has been fortunate enough to live through a rather peaceful period, every year everything seems a little better. It's hard for us to imagine periods when things go backwards, but they do very, very frequently.  Just in the last 2,000 years, we can identify at last half a dozen periods in western culture where technologies were lost that ancient civilizations had that we still don't fully understand exactly, so you know that there's been knowledge lost since as early as the Middle Ages. What we know about that period survives because of beautifully transcribed manuscripts out on some rocky island on the North Sea. Although it's not our experience, it's frighteningly easy to imagine technology backsliding.\n\nSo it is basically an unexplained item that is in part thrown in there to indicate the downward spiral of the world.\nThis review explains this concept:\n\nA script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan sets the stage, creating a near future world where crops are failing\u2014wheat is gone, okra is on the chopping block, and all farmers can grow with any reliability is corn\u2014and the planet is becoming a giant dustbowl.\nThey accomplish this visually with looming sand storms, as well as through small hints, mentioning food riots, hinting at hard times in the recent past, and painting a society that needs farmers more than engineers.

The first year, the water was too murky for any of the footage to be usable. \n\nFrom this source on the making of Planet Earth and Planet Earth II:\n\nAnderson, a part-time mountaineer, had been one of the crew who, 10 years ago in the mountains of \u200aPakistan, captured on video a snow leopard hunting \u2014 the first ever footage of its kind \u2014 for the first Planet Earth. For the sequel, he was expected to pull it off again, this time tracking down those rarest of central Asian predators in the mountains of Ladakh in India. \n\nAlso, for less big productions (from the first article again): \n\nSmall budgets and limited time mean that filmmakers use captive animals for hunts, chum waters to send sharks into feeding frenzies, and otherwise sensationalize footage, giving audiences a false impression of animal behavior.\n\nI also once watched 'Wilde dieren in Wildlands', a making of a nature documentary made by a Dutch Zoo.

Armstrong, by James R. Hansen, which the film is based on, and whose author is presumably the Jim mentioned in wcullen's answer.\n\nArmstrong never released any information about the contents of his [Personal Preference Kit]. He agreed to do so for publication in this boo, but reported that he was unable to find the manifest among his many papers.\n[...]\n\"I didn't bring anything else for myself,\" Neil would declare. \"At least not that I can remember.\" As for Janet, the only thing taken to the Moon for her was the olive branch pin. \"He didn't ask me if I wanted to send anything.\"\nPerhaps surprisingly, Armstrong took nothing else for family members--not even for his two boys, a fact that still distresses Janet. \"I assumed he had taken things to give to the boys later, but I don't believe he has ever given them anything. Neil can be thoughtful, but he does not give much time to being thoughtful, or at least to expressing it.\"\nAnother loved one that Neil apparently did not remember by taking anything of hers to the Moon was his daughter, Karen. What could have made the first Moon landing more meaningful \"for all mankind\" than a father honoring the cherished memory of his beloved little girl, by taking a picture of the child, dead now over seven years (she would have been a ten-year-old), one of her toys, an article of her clothing, a lock of hair, her baby bracelet? Astronaut Gene Cernan, just before he left the lunar surface on Apollo 17, had written the initials of his nine-year-old daughter, Tracy, in the dust. Buzz Aldrin carried photos of his children to the Moon. Charlie Duke left a picture of his family on the surface.\nWhat if Neil did something for Muffie but never told anyone about it, not even Janet, because it was of such an intensely personal nature? How much more would posterity esteem the character of the First Man? It could have elevated the first Moon landing to an even higher level of significance. Among those who feel so are Neil's sister June, who knew her brother as well as anyone.\n\"Did he take something of Karen with him to the Moon?\" was June's rhethorical question.\n\"Oh, I dearly hope so.\"\nPerhaps the mystery will be solved when humankind returns, as it surely will, to Tranquility Base.\n\nAs mentioned in the existing answers, this makes the incident a plausible educated theory, but I do find the added context w.r.t. Neil's living sons to be certainly relevant.\nI'm bothered by the exact textual match between Hansen and Singer's report of June Hoffman's response. Were they both present in the same interview? Did she give a word-for-word exactly identical response on two separate occasions? Is either of the two accounts a paraphrase of the other? (Just things to consider.)\n"}, {"question": "Why do old gun fight scenes sound so weird and cartoonish?", "answer": "\nTo answer this, let's take a quick look at Merriam-Webster's definition of \"art\", specifically the section on synonyms:\nART, SKILL, CUNNING, ARTIFICE, CRAFT mean the faculty of executing well what one has devised.\nIf we look at the art of foleying\u2014for this is what we're talking about\u2014it's sort of interesting to note that it's always been at least as much a fashionable thing as a technological thing. In the earliest radio and recording days, there were very simple techniques used to foley, though I think nowadays we tend to underestimate how cunning the early artists got.\nThis Mystery Science Theater 3000 sketch is one of my favorite lampoonings illustrating your very question.\nNow, why does anything sound the way it does in a movie? Do they record the actual thing in the actual environment and then play it? Almost never. And when that is done, it generally sounds cheap and lacks any kind of emotional impact which is after all the point of effects and movies generally.\nLet's take a really blatant example that will reflect back on the gunshot question. In the '50s, a realistic rocket sounded like this. Fairly close given the limitations of the technology, right? And Rocketship X-M is mostly silent in space, but not completely\u2014because boring!\u2014and then in the late '60s with 2001 and Planet of the Apes, you got a lot of silence in space. \nThen, of course, Star Wars comes along and all of a sudden ships are screaming through space right and left, and basically destroys the \"silent space\" thing for all but the most serious of sci-fi. The audience's expectations were forever changed.\nGun and fighting sounds present a bigger, subtler problem. If you've ever heard a fight, for example, you know it doesn't sound anything like a movie. If you've been in proximity to a gun, you know that not only does sound equipment not capture it, you probably wouldn't want to be in a theater where it was duplicated (as it would hurt your ears terribly).\nSo, if you're a foley, what do you do? You're not working in a vacuum. You can't just \"be realistic\", because\u2014to answer your question finally\u2014the audience won't buy it. What you have to do, most of the time, is what the audience expects. At the time, those KAPOING, POW and ZOINK sounds were shorthand for \"this is an exciting and dangerous (but also fun) gun battle\".\nI often wondered where the ricochets were coming from, myself. What had been hit, and where had the bullet been deflected? \nBut you really answered your own question: Gun battles sounded like that because that's how gun battles sounded. It's why cars of the era were guaranteed to explode into fireballs when shot with bullets\u2014because that's what cars are supposed to do when shot.\nThe more provocative thing to realize is that movies today are just as artificial in their tropes and effects, and a few years from now audiences will look back on current year movies and be just as amused.\n"}, {"question": "Why do low production studios intentionally release similar films shortly after a big banner?", "answer": "\nTo capitalize on the success of its predecessor.

B. Weiss about what is going on with Jon specifically? I feel like the shows ends on this optimistic note, where he's half-smiling and there are children around him. The children's presence felt really important in that scene, because it's this mark of the future and possibility. At the same time it's a little sad, because he's going into exile, basically, and leaving behind his past life. Were there conversations about that?\nDjawadi: Yeah, absolutely.

But Woolie liked to play it safe and use stuff he knew would work. That\u2019s all it was.\u201d\n\nMilt Kahl, another of Disney's \"Nine Old Men\" among Norman and Reitherman, confirms in a 1976 interview with Michael Barrier and Milton Gray:\n\nBarrier: I can't see how the re-use of animation saves money.\nKahl: It doesn't. The funny thing is that most of the time they spend more money trying to figure out how to re-use it than they would [animating the scene from scratch]. I'd rather see it animated from scratch; even if it's a little bit amateurish, at least it's fresh and new.\n\nThis primary-source reporting was then cited in the Wikipedia article on Wolfgang Reitherman, as notes 15 and 18 respectively:\n\nDuring his tenure, he [Wolfgang Reitherman] frequently used \"recycled\" or limited animation from prior works, presumably because it was a safer method for a quality product, though it was in fact more labor-intensive15, not because it was supposedly cheaper.16,17 Reitherman's use of recycling animation proved to be controversial within the studio as animator Milt Kahl lamented its use stating \"I detest the use of\u2014it just breaks my heart to see animation from Snow White used in The Rescuers. It kills me, and it just embarrasses me to tears.\"18\n\nAdmittedly, it is possible that the motivation was saving money or streamlining the production, and that the animators took a cynical or futile view, but in any case the practice is associated specifically with Reitherman and fellow animators felt it was less about money than about using what had worked in previous films.\n\nFor what it's worth, MacQuarrie's update cites different reasons for Beauty and the Beast, in a conversation with Gary Trousdale that still cites Reitherman's precedent:\n\n\u201cThe scene from Beauty and the Beast that we re-used was done for time, but not money. (well\u2026time IS money, but that\u2019s another story). We were just days from our final deadline to deliver, and we had an entire dance sequence (the last scene of the movie, not the ballroom) to do. Everyone was booked and busy, and we knew damn well that Woolie had established this precedent, so we took the Sleeping Beauty dance, re-sized and re-positioned it, and gave the note \u2018Note to Clean-up: clean up Aurora as Belle, clean up Prince Charming as Beast.\u2019\u201d\n\n"}, {"question": "Why does Hollywood not use foreigners in foreigners' roles?", "answer": "\nThis is not entirely the case from what I have seen. More frequently, a specific type of character (Russian, for instance) is played over and over again by the same, small, group of actors well known in the entertainment community. The same Russians get the same Russian parts. The same Italians get the same Italian parts.\nIf the part is too small to bother, or the actor sought is not available, studios don\u2019t bother trying to develop new talent for a one shot deal. They would rather go with someone who can get close to acting the part. And, they will count on the audience suspending their belief for the sake of the storyline. The belief being that it is better entertainment to have good acting than realistic portrayal. Especially when the portrayal of the character must be exaggerated for the audience to get what would normally be subtleties.\nCase in point, I like action movies. Combat movies are shot predominantly with actors who have never been trained in combat. Instead, they go through a crash course on combat techniques. Then, their scenes are choreographed for the maximum visual effect. The audience impact is valued over the actual realism. Even if it means that certain effective combat techniques are replaced with those that would go against actual training, be ill-advised, or be down-right disastrous  in actual combat. When actual combat veterans are cast in speaking roles, the realism of combat scenes increases. But, the acting and dialogue quality suffers. It is not in the combat veterans\u2019 skill set. Can it be taught/learned? Yes, at the expense of time.

In reality, one could argue the only true act that happened during the film was breaking off his engagement with Evelyn due to his realization of his psychotic visions becoming more and more intense as the film goes on.\nIn the end, Bateman seemingly kills dozens of police officers, something that would not easily be forgiven, forgotten, nor without being the talk of the town and also among his socialite 'friends'. Even his 'confession' is aluded to by his lawyer as a laugh as they believe Bateman is too reserved to commit such acts.\nThis further portrays him as actually battling inside his head most of the time, instead of a physical representation of his acts.

Vader is not just passively standing there and watching the Emperor torture Luke to death, and far from showing how evil Vader had become, the scene is actually the point at which Vader comes back to the light side.\nHave another look at the scene (thanks to @Paulie_D for linking it). From the moment the Emperor begins torturing Luke, Vader finds himself torn between his loyalty to the Emperor, and his love for his son. He looks at the Emperor, then down at Luke. Then back at the Emperor, then down at Luke. He knows he has to choose between them, and he chooses Luke: he picks the Emperor up and throws him to his death, at the cost of his own life.\n\n\n\nThe 2011 Blu-Ray version makes it more explicit, dubbing over a small \"No\" as he watches Luke get tortured, and then a louder \"NO!!\" as he moves forward and seizes the Emperor. It's quite apparent that, at that moment at least, he does care about Luke.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Vader was never actually that loyal to the Emperor in the first place. As early as Episode 3, he was planning to overthrow him and rule with Padme (which of course, did not happen):\n\nANAKIN: The Chancellor is weak! I can overthrow him!\n\nHe tries it again after he learns that Luke is his son. His entire motivation for trying to turn Luke to the Dark Side is so that they can overthrow the Emperor and rule together:\n\nDARTH VADER: Join me, and together we will rule the galaxy as father and son!\n\nAs for why Vader seems to simply accept his fate when the Emperor orders Luke to kill him, there are three reasons:\n\nThe Sith operate under the \"Rule of Two\", which means there can only be two of them at any one time. This naturally leads to a lot of backstabbing. In Episode 3, the Emperor orders Anakin to kill his previous apprentice, Count Dooku, just as he ordered Luke to kill Vader. Vader probably realizes the irony of the situation (especially since, as I already noted, he was planning to betray the Emperor).\nHe's incapacitated and has just lost his hand and his lightsaber. There's really not much he can do to stop Luke.\nHe feels he is beyond redemption and that death is the only way out:\n\n\nDARTH VADER: It's too late for me, son.\n\n\nTL;DR: Vader did care about Luke, he wasn't just standing there and watching him get tortured to death, and while he served the Emperor, he wasn't as blindly subservient as you believe him to be.\n"}, {"question": "How do they film movies that take place in a single season?", "answer": "\nPrincipal photography, where the actors are in front of the camera, usually takes less than 3 months. But principal photography is just one part of producing a movie. The whole process can take a year or more. Movie production is generally broken into 3 stages:\n\nPre-production: The script is finalized, crew and cast are hired, there are rehearsals, teams build the sets and scout locations, make costumes, props, apply for permits, etc. This usually takes several months.\nPrincipal photography: The actors are on sets, or on locations, being filmed. This takes 1-3 months, typically.\nPost-production: Edit the film, score the film, add special effects, ADR (recording the audio of voice-overs and the like), marketing, etc. This is often the longest part of a film's production schedule, commonly taking 6 months or more.\n\nSo principal photography can easily be completed within one season. But it doesn't even need to be. As others have pointed out, much of what you see is \"movie magic\": fake snow on the ground, the actors pretending to be cold when it's actually summertime, etc. Also, the environment only needs to look like a particular season for shots taken outdoors! If the actors are indoors, they can shoot that at any time of the year that they want.\n"}, {"question": "Why hasn't the elevator been fixed?", "answer": "\nIt's just a reoccurring joke that management is lazy and how extensive the damage was. The elevator was damaged due to a malfunctioning experiment of Leonard's (He wrongly calculated the mixture for the experimental rocket Fuel he was developing), which Sheldon recognized as going critical so he placed it in the elevator. It exploded inside and took out the entire elevator cab. (The Staircase Implementation, Season 3, Episode 22)\nThe cost of a new elevator cab (and maybe the motor/hydraulic system and everything else) and structural repairs to the elevator shaft for a ~8 story building like that would be in the low to mid 6 digits. And would be a labor intensive multi-month project. From a New York Times Article on modernizing an Existing, working elevator system:\n\nIn a six-story building, a standard elevator modernization (frequently involving replacement of the cab rather than remodeling it) costs about $100,000, including consultant fees, said Joseph Caracappa, an elevator consultant ... A project in a 6- to 12-story building generally costs around $125,000, while anything taller will require roughly $150,000 to $175,000. [He] on my building\u2019s project, said that these figures assume that some components won\u2019t need changing. Our 89-year-old drum-hoisted elevator, being well past its sell-by date, needed everything, which is why our job cost substantially more. Also, we spent about $20,000 on the interior finishes, on the higher side of a range from $7,500 to $30,000.\n\nThat's putting a regular fix at < $200,000. An explosion would likely add much more cost to it. \nBetween the High Cost, the amount of work required, and not having anyone to blame/sue/recover the cost from, it's understandable why the elevator has not been fixed.\n"}, {"question": "Is Bran literally the world's memory?", "answer": "\nWhat Bran is referring to is his ability to use greensight to see the past, something he has been able to do at will since inheriting the role of Three-Eyed Raven.

Modern cinema, by which I mean the industry that distributes and exhibits mainstream content (so any new releases), are exclusively distributed in digital format.\nIn early 2002, Hollywood sought to standardize this technology for the incredible advantages it possessed. Digital projectors have been industry standard since 2005 in the UK, but much earlier in America and China. Due to its cinematic heritage and relative size, the UK is almost always used as the 'control' in rolling out cinematic technologies. It is usually measured as an experiment, and just as the introduction of sound, colour and 3D cinemas required refits and refurbishment, this is now happening with digital distribution. \nThe rest of the world is moving in exactly the same direction, but with different levels of immersion in the cinematic process.\nMany cinemas use a system called DCP which is literally a USB pen that gets shipped around inside a case. It improves accountability on behalf of cinema-pirates, as each Pen has a certain number of licences on it. A slightly more old fashioned variation of this is large portable hard-drives, but these are being phased out of circulation too.\nA DCP is simply a file that requires activation from a licence. The DCP is signed for by the cinema, and then the projectionist is given the licence activation code to allow the content to be played. Some cinemas have a licence retainer, or master licence for content.\nBecause most multiplex cinemas are part of an exhibition chain, they are typically less vigilant in safeguarding their content, and will handle the management of their content internally, negating such stringent protection. \nIncreasingly, satellite technology is being explored in order to reduce the cost of distribution (which has already more than halved in the past 10 years). Under satellite systems, the film is literally downloaded from a secure server and the film is activated for use via satellite; projectors can even be controlled remotely through the satellite, which centralizes the entire process externally.\nThis is a method that has been spearheaded in the UK by such projects as National Theatre Live and Opera Live. Whilst they do broadcast globally, they remain a minority interest for exhibitors (although a growing one, due to their success). The legacy of these projects will not, however, come from their content but by their method of distribution. Even now, many distributors are promoting their ease of use as leverage to persuade developers to pursue satellite distribution as it reduces the overheads dramatically.\nAs with many instances of private enterprise, the real driving force behind satellite distribution is the revenue stream it creates, and the relative immediacy of this income. \nIt's the worst kept secret of most cinemas that the most lucrative single-income source is the adverts that are exhibited before a feature.\nTo explain: a single multiplex may have an opening weekend for a particular film that takes a significant box office. To take this quarters tentpole (Avengers:Age of Ultron) as an example; \nA 12 screen MP may take an optimistic BO:W/E of \u00a336k (approx $55)... so if a film has legs for a month and its returns are inevitably diminishing week by week, we're looking at a best case scenario of \u00a370k ($100,000 dollars): and let me stress this would be an absolute wet dream for a cinema to make these numbers on a single film. Advertisement, by comparison? for a modest 5 screen art house cinema, you're looking at an annual income of about \u00a3200K ($300K)... and that is, most importantly, guaranteed. \nAdverts don't need to be good; infact, they're often awful. They don't rely on word of mouth, critical acclaim or any amount of audience reception. They're a guaranteed revenue stream that will double the best possible B/O of any film, they're value increases proportionately to box office takings: they (sadly) represent the backbone of modern cinema.\nHere's the hook: almost every advertisement content company in the world is moving not only in the direction of digital content, but they're universally moving towards satellite. Why? because, comparitively, it costs pittance.\nWith the exception of implementation (which usually consists of a satellite receiver and something called a [LANSAT processor][4] [Loca-Area-Network-SATellite]), this type of distribution entirely cuts out the cost of getting the content to cinemas. Distributors simply author a file, fire it out over their satellite connection for their respective exhibitors to download (or stream if its live content: hence satellite and not unpredictable fibre/internet connections) and deal with any potential problems through modifying the coding; which is in itself rare.\nIf we compare this to traditional methods of P&P (Print and postage), the gains are obvious.\nFilm has to be printed onto celluloid, which is costly and creates only one copy. If you want to open in every cinema in the US (unlikely, but lets pretend this example is a Star Wars Scenario) you're looking at 40,000 prints. Now try and imagine a global box office...so quadruple it, at least.\nYou also have to factor in the cost of transportation of said prints, degradations and recirculation, repair (the days of 35mm splice jobs are long gone, and not soon missed) and, most overlooked of all...insurance.\nMany people realise that films stock used to be made of the incredibly flammable silver nitrate, as demonstrated during the finale of Tarrantino's Inglorious Basterds. During these early days of cinema, the relative hazard of transporting these prints was absorbed by the distribution companies.\nWhen insurance firms became common practice, this cost was phased onto them... and when the film stock changed and became less hazardous, what did the insurance firms do.....?\nNot give a f%!k. \nEven up until digital content distribution, insurance companies refused to acknowledge that the relative risk of transportation had diminished, and were able to charge disproportionate costs for film distribution; a practice that continues with 35mm, although it's a dying market so prices are dropping significantly.\nSatellite distribution has removed all these overheads completely, and there is simply no feasible alternative on any medium to large scale operation.\nIt's fair to say that most if not all cinemas are now fitted with digital projectors, and within the next 20 years (as they become satellite compatible) we will probably see the extinction of the projectionist: they'll become something that's wheeled out on special occasions to demonstrate a vestigial technology, to show off its novelty. That's more or less the case now, actually. \n[4]: http://lansat.com/ a brand name\n"}, {"question": "In what order should a newcomer watch Star Wars episodes?", "answer": "\nThe Machete Order seems to be a great idea.

The general movie audience does not respond well to realistic depictions of explosions or cannons at a distance.\nFrom the other SE, a partial excerpt of a great answer (that you should upvote as well):\n\nMost film is art, not life/reality. Sound designers have to match the visual art on screen with the sonic art of their mix, and that usually includes a certain amount of \"realer than real\", suspending some of what we \"know\" about physics in order to tell the story in a way that translates to this 2-dimensional, 2-sense media.\nCase in point, when we see some big impact on screen, such as a lightning bolt, we as audience members expect to hear it, much as we expect to hear the starship Enterprise whooshing by at warp speed, even though there's no air (and thus no air movement to create the \"whoosh\") in space. We also expect to see it match up with the visual effect on the screen; this both increases the overall impact of whatever just happened, and keeps us suspending disbelief that we're not watching a movie, we're looking through a window into another universe. Hearing a delayed sound effect might jerk us out of the director's world and wonder what's going on with the media system, and once we've left, it's hard to get us back.\nThe speed of sound delay would also, even in the ideal, make us feel further from the action. You see a lightning bolt hit a distant mountainside. 3 seconds later, you hear an ear-splitting thunderclap. While that might be totally accurate to the scope of the shot, in the ultimate ideal of the audience totally suspending reality and believing they're physically in this world you've created, they'll be thinking \"damn, I'm glad I'm not over there\", when in cinema the location of the camera can jump from place to place as needed, and the very next jump cut could put the audience right in the thick of the aftermath of that thunderbolt.\nYou'll also see sound designers architecting a \"double explosion\". They'll engineer a big, powerful explosion sound right at the moment you see it, then the visual effects guys will put in a massive shock wave, and as that passes by the camera the sound designers will add an extra \"whoosh\". Or, with a slight delay (and a really fast shockwave), the designers will engineer a small crescendo to the big boom, so you know it's coming. These little audio tricks aren't what you hear in comparable \"real life\" events, but then again, neither is the sound of a movie punch or a movie explosion compared to the real thing.\n\nSlightly related, the Mythbusters episode 165 \"Blow your own Sail\" had a clip titled \"Sounds Bogus\", where they compared actual explosions to movie ones:\n\nIn a recent episode of \"MythBusters\" on Discovery Channel, show hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman worked with Meyer Sound to investigate whether the \"big bangs\"\u2014specifically gunshots and explosions\u2014heard in movie soundtracks are sonically faithful to the real events. The episode, entitled \"Blow Your Own Sail,\" was aired on May 11, 2011.\nFor the recent episode, [the hosts] reunited with \"Honorary MythBuster\" and Meyer Sound Staff Scientist Roger Schwenke, with the goal to compare highly accurate, on-the-scene audio recordings to their Hollywood counterparts.\n\"Real gunshots and explosions are too loud to reproduce exactly in a theater and would damage people's hearing,\" says Schwenke. \"So the question is: are movie sound effects simply the real sound played back at a safe level, or have they been changed in ways other than just level.\"\n\nThe results showed that the sounds are faked in movies.

He did not want to approach it as a brave new world or interesting future, which is how Star Trek, as one example, kind of approaches its world. Lucas felt like he was retelling an old story, not presenting a future.\nA long time ago in a place far away, or something similar to those words is often used at the beginning of fables and it is familiar to most movie-goers. It has a story-telling ring to it, and those words have been used in Aesop and other story-telling venues. I believe Lucas wanted to start out by giving the movie viewer that familiarity. He did not want the first impression to be a space-ship chase. He wanted the first impression to be \u201cThis is an old fable.\u201d because that is what it was to him. Then he followed that with a magnificent space-ship chase, which was a brilliant contrast in my opinion, and wonderfully backed up by the orchestral music. The whole approach was brilliant.\nBut I think his reason for doing it went beyond the contrast. I believe, he genuinely wanted to begin by telling the viewers \u201cthis is a fable\u201d, because that is what long ago and far away suggests. He wanted to begin his movie with that familiarity.\nAnd, just to add, \u201cRescue the Princess\u201d is also straight from countless fables. The movie still works as a futuristic looking space adventure, but it has got its roots in fable.\n"}, {"question": "What was the first crossover movie like The Avengers, using only movie franchises?", "answer": "\nFrench gentleman thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin battles the English detective Sherlock Holmes in the 1910 German drama film serial Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contra Sherlock Holmes. \nWikipedia says:\n\nA contemporary of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc (1864\u20131941) was the creator of the character of gentleman thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin who, in Francophone countries, has enjoyed a popularity as long-lasting and considerable as Sherlock Holmes in the English-speaking world.\n\nThere had been individual Ars\u00e8ne Lupin and Sherlock Holmes films before this, the first appearing in 1908 and 1900 respectively. \n"}, {"question": "Was The Nightmare Before Christmas meant to be a Halloween or Christmas Movie?", "answer": "\nAccording to the film's director Henry Selick, it's supposed to be a Halloween Movie.\nAccording to The Daily Mail\n\nHenry Selick, 64, who directed the 1993 film recently spoke about its themes at a Q&A at the Telluride Horror Show in Colorado.\n  He was asked whether the film is a Halloween or Christmas movie.\n  Henry explained that, while Christmas plays a factor in the story, at the end of the day, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a story about Halloween\n\nAnd from Entertainment Weekly\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Halloween movie,\u201d Selick responded, finally putting the debate to rest.\n\nWhy?

Things worked a bit differently\nback then: you\u2019d pay your nickel, take a seat, and watch a continuous\nloop of a feature (mixed with cartoon interludes) for as long as your\nheart desired.\nIn 1912, Broadway producer Nils Granlund was hired as the advertising\nmanager for a chain of East Coast movie theaters owned by entrepreneur\nMarcus Loew. Here, Granlund produced the first-ever trailer -- a\none-minute spot for the upcoming Broadway show, The Pleasure Seekers\n-- which featured mainly cut up clips from the production\u2019s rehearsals. The advertisement was shown to audiences after the feature\nfilm, rather than before it.\n\nThat's for a Broadway show, but movies followed:\n\nThat same year, in Chicago, an early film visionary by the name of\nWilliam Selig decided to apply 19th century society\u2019s interest in\nprint serials (stories published in installments) to films. What\nresulted was a 13-episode film serial called \u201cThe Adventures of\nKathlyn.\u201d As with print serials, it was important for Selig to end\neach segment on a suspenseful note, so as to encourage people to come\nsee the next one.

However, as the OP quoted, it's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone at all costs. That being said, her initial intent was to not give the stone to Banner.\nThe reason why the Ancient One didn't already know about Strange's actions (i.e., Strange willingly giving the stone to Thanos) during the time of her and Banner's conversation is because she died in Dr. Strange; and, just as she told Strange right before she died, she wasn't able to see past that moment in time (nor was she able to see Strange's actual future... only its possibilities).\n\nANCIENT ONE: I've spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can't see past it. I've prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there's always another. And they all lead here, but never further.\n...\nI never saw your future. Only its possibilities.\n\nSo, her coming to learn about Strange actions in Avengers: Infinity War was new information to her, and, with her knowing that Strange is the best Master of the Mystic Arts, she then says that perhaps she made a mistake [in judgement] when initially not wanting to give the Time Stone to Banner (and then immediately gives it to him).\n"}, {"question": "What did the title of Silence of the Lambs refer to?", "answer": "\nIt refers to a conversation between Clarice and Hannibal Lecter. In order for Lecter to help with her investigation, he demands she tell him information from her personal life, to satisfy his curiosity. \nHer story begins with her upbringing in West Virginia with her father. He was later shot. She lived with her mother, but was sent away to live with her uncle as she couldn't afford to keep her. Her uncle owned a sheep and horse farm, and she learned one night that the lambs on the farm were slaughtered - in horror, she ran away.\nThis story is covered in the script. Note the highlighted part towards the end:\n\nClarice (voiceover): Lambs. The lambs were screaming...\nDr. Lecter: They were slaughtering the spring lambs?\nClarice: Yes...! They were screaming.\nDr. Lecter: So you ran away...\nClarice: No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused.\n  They wouldn't run...\nDr. Lecter: But you could. You did.\nClarice: I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...\nDr. Lecter (voiceover): Where were you going?\nClarice (voiceover): I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very odd. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so\n  heavy. So heavy...\nClarice (voiceover): I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at\n  the Lutheran Orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...\nDr. Lecter (voiceover): But what became of your lamb?\n(no response)\nDr. Lecter (voiceover): Clarice...?\nDr. Lecter: You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?\nClarice: Yes.\nDr. Lecter: Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the\n  dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?\nClarice: Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.\n\nThe Catherine referred to is the U.S. Senator's daughter who is kidnapped and who Clarice is trying to locate.\nThe implication is that by saving Catherine, by saving this innocent girl (innocent like the lambs), she'll no longer be woken by the howling of the lambs in her dreams - the lambs she was too weak to save. Instead, she'll have saved the innocent and she'll be able to sleep in peace.\n"}, {"question": "Are scorpions frequent in US suburb gardens or is this a plot exaggeration?", "answer": "\nThe story of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids takes place in Fresno, California.

He goes over to him, sits down, and they both start watching TV. From that point on their actions are identical: They get caught up in the show at the same time, AND they tilt their heads slightly to the left at the same time.\nLater on, we see that they both love the same things naturally. Little Forrest loves to fish. Once again they get caught up in the sitting \"action\" of fishing with their heads tilted slightly to the left.\nPlease observe this YouTube clip that shows the father and son tilting their heads to the left. Forrest, the father, goes to his son at around 4:20 minutes; they tilt their heads at around 4:38 minutes. \n\n\n\nIn this YouTube clip, we see at 1:11 minutes that Little Forrest has a knack for ping pong.

While the performances of cast and crew could be tailored to fit the scene, the \"audience laugh\" - the aural cue to the viewer that something funny had happened - couldn't be controlled as easily. Once audiences had seen that scene once or twice, the laughter would either be at the wrong time or too short, or worse no one would laugh at all since they'd seen the \"punchline\" multiple times. \nThe main reason behind the usage of laugh tracks is to replicate the experience of being with an audience while viewing. Watching TV at home is usually a solitary experience, so film-makers attempted to recreate the atmosphere of a theater by introducing laugh tracks. Eventually this expanded to include a range of emotive aural cues - applause lines, the \"awww\" moment, cheers and whistles during romantic scenes, etc.\nMore specifically, though, why are laugh tracks not used in film when they are so prevalent in TV? Largely because films are intended for the theater, and in the theater the viewer will be surrounded by an audience. In the theater, the rule is \"laughter begets laughter\", so if you can make a few people laugh or applaud, other audience members will pick up on that and produce genuine laughs as well. The same can be said of comedy shows or political rallies that use \"plants\" to generate the same effect - a few paid supporters who will laugh or cheer at the right time, thereby encouraging others to do the same. The same ethos applies to laugh tracks stimulating laughter in the \"at home\" audience. \n"}, {"question": "What does Mr Bean have against the three-wheeled car?", "answer": "\nIt's a meme. \nIn the UK, everybody hates those cars. \nGoogle refs: Jeremy Clarkson/Top Gear, Reliant Robin or Reliant Supervan; Only Fools & Horses. \nTry this Youtube video to see Clarkson \"testing\" one - \n\n\n\nEven the members of the owner's club in the Top Gear video are quite aware of how bad their cherished vehicles really are.\nSeriously, they were actually quite dangerous, unless you kept additional weight on the passenger side.\nTheir fibre-glass construction also made them deadly in any crash.\nThey were popular, really, only because you didn't need a full motor vehicle driving license to drive one unaccompanied, you only needed a motor-cycle license.\nThis is the \"Supervan\" variant, made [in]famous by Del-Boy & Rodney Trotter, in Only Fools & Horses.\nThe meme already existed by the time this show was first made in 1981, the abysmal quality of the vehicle adding to the characterisations of the protagonists.\n\n"}, {"question": "What happened to the humans in \u201cCars\u201d (that is if they ever existed)?", "answer": "\nThere is no public canonical explanation.\nHowever...there is a semi-official answer...\n\nThe Cars franchise has never offered an official explanation for any of these mysteries.

IMDB lists these types as 'Alan Smithee' films, though other pseudonyms are currently allowed.This is just one article defining these -- there are a number of movie glossaries listed on Google to define these terms from (supposedly) film classes at .edu sites -- and generally speaking a \"Theatrical Cut\" refers to the original version released to cinemas.\n"}, {"question": "What properties did Disney buy from 21st Century Fox?", "answer": "\nAccording to this article,\nMovies\nDisney will acquire following movie franchises from Fox.\n\nX-Men movies\nFantastic Four movies\nStar Wars (the rights to the original and prequel trilogies)\nDeadpool series\nAvatar series\nPlanet of the Apes series\n\nIt will also acquire some of the older films.\n\nNight at the Museum films\nHome Alone films\nDoctor Dolittle films\nAlvin and the Chipmunks films\n\nThough, it should be noted that Alien franchise is now owned by Disney (Thanks to Kutulmike for correction).\nTV Shows\n\n\u201cModern Family\u201d \u2014 Airs on ABC, produced by 20th Century Fox Television\n\u201cSpeechless\u201d \u2014 Airs on ABC, co-produced by Fox and ABC\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d \u2014 Airs on NBC, produced by Fox\n\u201cEmpire\u201d \u2014 Airs on Fox, produced by Fox\n\u201cThe X-Files\u201d (revived) \u2014 Airs on and produced by Fox\n\u201cThe Gifted\u201d \u2014 Airs on and produced by Fox\n\u201cThe Americans\u201d \u2014 Airs on FX, produced by FX Productions\n\u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d \u2014 Airs on FX, produced by FX Productions\n\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 Produced by Fox Television Animation\n\u201cFamily Guy\u201d \u2014 Produced by Fox Television Animation\n\u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d \u2014 Produced by Fox Television Animation\n\u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u2014 Produced by Fox Television Animation\n\u201cKing of the Hill\u201d \u2014 Produced by Fox Television Animation\n\nSome older TV Shows are-\n\n\u201c24\u201d\n\u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d\n\u201cHill Street Blues\u201d\n\u201cM_A_S*H\u201d\n\u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d\n\u201cThe Shield\u201d\n\nChannels\nDisney will acquire more channels from the deal, including:\n\n20th Century Fox\nNational Geographic\nFox Networks Group\nFX\nStar\nEndemol Shine Group\n\nSports Networks\n\nYES Network (which covers the New York Yankees)\nFox Sports Regional networks (often spread throughout the country)\nSky Sports\nStar Sports\nFox Deportes\n\nOther references-\n\nNew York Times\nPolygon\nAxios\nVox\nBusiness Insider\nPolygon\n\n"}, {"question": "Why does James Bond use his real name?", "answer": "\nThe use of monikers such as M and Q is, IMO, more to do with tradition and traditional anonymity than secrecy. (See my answer to another Bond question for more on this.) You can see colleagues mingling socially (the opening scenes of Licence to Kill come to mind) and Bond pops up to M's flat on a couple of occasions. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny are all invited to Bond's wedding in OHMSS, and the scene, IIRC, begins with \"Your Royal Highnesses\". I'd say that this out-of-office mingling isn't done without knowledge of their real names. Furthermore, M is often a well known political appointee just like the head of the real MI6. The first M was a Sir Miles Messervy.\nJames Bond too has an alias within MI6\u2014he is 007.

However David Prowse was a body-builder, had acting experience so he had the right look at 6 foot 6 inches tall.  He was also from the UK where many of the scenes involving Vader were made.\nJames Earl Jones is to a degree the opposite - he has an amazing voice, and although a more accomplished actor than Prowse, does not have the right bodybuilder physical presence and is (only) 6 foot 2 inches tall.\nFinally, why Sebastian Shaw and not Prowse for the final scene with Vader? They may have thought that Prowse, only in his late 40's, might look a little too young to be Luke's father, and the accent would have been too striking a difference to the 'in helmet' voice.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, political scientist and game theorist, studied the reign of Leopold II, King of Belgium and Congo. The exact same person rules these two kingdoms in very different ways, but there is a reason for this: the power was not held by the same people/structure. Two different kingdoms, two different ways to conquer/keep the power. \n\nAbstract \n  From 1885 until 1908 Leopold II was not only the King of Belgium but also the personal owner of the Congo Free State. The policy outcomes during his reign turned out to be fundamentally different in the two countries: Whereas in Belgium he improved living conditions, in the Congo he established a brutal tyranny. This paper analyses the reasons for these different leadership styles of Leopold II by means of the 'selectorate theory'. The selectorate theory explains policy outcomes as a function of governance institutions. It assumes that the ruler maximizes his own utility which means first of all to sustain himself in power. Under Belgium's governmental institutions Leopold II required broad support from the general public but in the Congo he only needed a very small group of supporters. To reduce the possibility that Leopold's different leadership styles were caused mainly by racism his period is compared to the reign of the Congolese leader Mobutu Sese Seko. \nLeopold II and the Selectorate: An Account in Contrast to a Racial Explanation, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita\n\nThe same thing can be said for Essos and Westeros.

He plays no part in the fight against the Night King, no warging his way into the undead dragon to kill the Night King. He just sits there and pretty much everywhere else this season.   \nIn order to seek closure for his character, I think he can see the past present and future. He knows what is about to happen, with the Night King, with Daenerys, with Jon. So he just plays along doing nothing, letting the present play out towards the future he has seen.   \nHe says to at least 3 characters that everything they did brought them where they are now, where they belong. Jaime, Theon, and Jon. Every one of them says to Bran that they wish things had been different, that they could have chosen differently. But Bran says to all of them that they were exactly where/who they were supposed to be.   \nThis makes me believe Bran is just letting the present plays into the future without interference.   \nA possible reason could be because he turned Wylis into Hodor by interfering in the past. So he's afraid or guilty.  \nHe must have seen him be King. Hence he says he travelled all this way. When Tyrion says he doesn't want to be Hand, Bran says he doesn't want to be King either.   \nHe says he came all this way to become King but he doesn't want to be King. So, he's letting the present play into the future without interference.   \nBran knows, like Theon, Jaime and Jon, that things could have been different if they made different choices but he also believes the things he actually chose led him to where he is now, where he belongs.

Sadly, I think in many ways she was right. It\u2019s just this whole idea that Bran has become a much smaller part of the character\u2019s brain, when before 100 percent of his head was taken up with being Bran Stark. Now, that\u2019s just one tiny file in a huge system. But certainly, he\u2019s almost completely a different character. He acts utterly differently, and really any semblance of personality he used to have has gone.\nHBO: Is there anything left of the old Bran?\nIsaac Hempstead Wright: In Episode 4 [\u201cThe Spoils of War\u201d] he says, \u201cI remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now,\u201d which sums up exactly the situation Bran is in.

He\u2019s really like a human supercomputer.\nHBO: How challenging was it to essentially take on that new character while still maintaining the fact that you are in some small way Bran?\nIsaac Hempstead Wright: It was definitely difficult to get it right. I had a meeting with [series creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss], and they wanted him to be quite monotone and agenda-less, but at the same time have a slight flair, so it wasn\u2019t just like listening to a robot talk.

He knows that he can never actually rule in name, but he wants to be at least the real power behind the throne. For that to happen he needs to setup a puppet king that he can control. \nSo Lord Baelish's plan was to back Joffrey's claim to the throne and isolate him from his mother (and the Lannisters) with Lord Stark serving as Joffrey's regent since he is under-aged. In return for this he expected to become Lord Stark's right hand man, giving him a great amount of power especially given Stark's limited political skills.\nBut Lord Stark had other ideas. He wanted to expose Joffrey's parentage and install Stannis Baratheon and the new king of Westeros. Lord Baelish knew Stannis very well from serving with him in the Small Council. Stannis is a humorless man who had no patience for his scheming and was someone he could not easily manipulate, thus costing him a great amount of power and influence. This was, to him, unacceptable.\nSo Lord Baelish sided with the Lannisters and helped them foil Stark's plan. Now he has the trust of the Lannisters with all the influence that gives him.

There's not a high concept, story arc, external villains, or greater purpose.\nDon't confuse \"serialized\" and \"soap opera\".\nNot Serialized\nWhat serialization isn't: From the 1960s to 1990s, in the vast majority of TV shows, every episode starts the same, and ends right there. Wesley has saved the day, Riker's latest fling has moved on, Sam Beckett has finished his work and \"quantum leapt\", Monk and Psych solve the case, etc. The show always reset back to starting conditions; no evolution ever happened, it's jokingly called \"Groundhog Day\".  That's because real money was made in syndication, and small stations don't want to deal with airing sequence, and want a show anyone can start at any episode and enjoy. If you catch the show every Monday at the laundromat (even though it airs daily), that should work.\n\nNon-serial: almost any sitcom, 2-1/2 Men, The West Wing (mostly), Star Trek: Next Generation\n\nSerialized (not soap)\nSome shows threw away the opportunities for syndication, to tell a deeper tale in a big story arc.  The archetypal example being Babylon-5.  They became serialized - there are fewer (or no) \"Groundhog Day\" episodes, events cause irrevocable changes, and it's super confusing to join in the middle.   If you catch the show every Monday at the laundromat, you'll be totally confused - why is Babylon-5 fighting Earth all of a sudden?\nYou're expected to watch from episode 1. This is a big difference between serials and soaps - you can't possibly watch a soap opera from episode 1; they're so hastily produced they didn't even keep the tapes.\nSerialized Soap operas\nThe prototypical soap opera was a show like General Hospital. These aired for 30 minutes every weekday.  They were cheap shows to begin with, and at that tempo, they pretty much had to be done live, or in a live (3-camera) format with very simple editing.  They were so cheap they didn't bother filming or videotaping the as-aired episodes.   Needless to say, they're not meant to start watching at episode 1; you're expected to join the fun today and then tune in tomorrow, and they're written to encourage that and to \"hook you in\".  For that reason they avoid  \"big head\" stuff like revolution plots or intergalactic wars. That's what makes House of Cards not a soap.\nSoap opera was the (sarcastic) name, since they aired between 11 am and 3 pm, were mainly watched by homemakers (housewives), and so the commercials were homemaking supplies such as soap. As the definition was broadened to include things like Dallas which were not midday daily shows, critics latched on to the term \"soap\", and it stuck.\nBut the writing makes them a \"soap\" - it is hasty, and all about interpersonal relationships, because that's universally appealing and easy to film in simple sets. There is high drama amongst the characters with arcs across many episodes. But not a lot externally - No high-concept stories, no epics, no world-changing story arcs.  Johann might spend a season stealing Karen's inheritance, but they'd never spend a season helping the CIA catch Iranian spies.\nSome series may have higher production values (Dallas being an archetypal example). The distinction you're looking for is that many people say that if you increase the production values, it's still a \"soap\". Before Dallas, an expensive soap was unthinkable, but it opened the floodgates.\nSo  what makes a soap is\n\nSerialized\nFocusing on interpersonal drama among regular people\nlack of high concept or extreme situation.\n\n\nSoap: Gossip Girl, What/If, Pretty Little Liars, Revenge\nNon-Soap: Orphan Black, Man in the High Castle, Humans, Halt and Catch Fire\n\n"}, {"question": "Why didn't Hugo Weaving reprise his role as Red Skull?", "answer": "\nMaybe because he was not interested to do it.

Amazons are skilled in hand to hand combats. They are also used to the fact that fight is an honorable thing. But all of this was changed in World War I when automated arms were introduced and the armies were fighting with guns, bombs, rifles etc. It was no longer what would he call honorable.\nTherefore, he wanted that culture shock. Which is why, he chose World War I.\nHere is an excerpt of his interview given to IGN(emphasis mine),\n\nIGN: The decision to set Wonder Woman\u2019s solo film in World War I is very interesting. It's not a time period we've seen a heck of a lot of in movies these days. Can you talk a bit about that decision?\nCharles Roven: One of the reasons that we picked World War I was we felt that it [worked] in terms of that war and what it meant to Diana. Diana was raised on Themyscira with the lore, the history of the Amazons, and the Amazons, you know from the canon and the New 52, were created to be inspirations towards mankind. And [they] helped promote peace and goodwill amongst men and mankind. But at some point, they were enslaved by mankind and they had to break their shackles, which is why they wear the bracelets, as symbols of that. And they were given Themyscira by Zeus.\nBut they're always training and they're warriors, and there's great pride to their abilities, their fighting abilities, etc. And even though they haven't had any war on Themyscira, they're used to fighting being an honorable thing. They're used to one on one combat, or even if it's armies fighting each other, ultimately that great legacy of fighting hand to hand. The best warrior wins. There's a lot of contact, and World War I was the first war where that changed, where it became more remote. You were killing people -- whether it was through guns, through rifles, through mortars, through bombs, through gas attacks -- that you didn't even know, that you never looked into their eyes. And it ceased to be what I would call an \u201chonorable war.\u201d And so we wanted that culture shock. And those images of no man's land and the trenches and fighting for years against an enemy that you really don't see, who's a hundred, two hundred yards next to you, but you never see their face, we just wanted those images in the movie because we thought that it would be very, very symbolic to her.\n\n"}, {"question": "What do I need to know before watching 3D for the first time", "answer": "\n\nAre 3D glasses needed?\n\nYes.

Note that many films have scenes, not the whole film in 3D, so you may still enjoy the experience overall.\n\nIf so are they provided?\n\nYes.

Copyrights allow the author (or owner of the copyright) to retain exclusive rights to use the work or significant portions of it. Trademarks do not work that way.\nTrademarks are meant to provide legal recourse when a business uses the same or similar name, logo, design, catchphrase, etc., as another business in a way that competes with or damages the reputation of the business that holds the trademark. Words, phrases, logos, symbols, and designs can be trademarked. Like copyrights, authors of such works are protected whether or not their trademark is registered, but registration makes legal protection much easier.\nThe producers of Spaceballs did not have to clear the character name of Pizza the Hutt before they released the movie, but they probably did it just in case. Two likely reasons why Pizza Hut would have allowed it are:\n\nIt did not compete with or damage their brand. The movie is not pizza or food of any kind, and while the name is funny and the character is an evil one, there is no reference at all beyond the name itself to the real world Pizza Hut. The lack of competition or damage means that Pizza Hut would have a hard time winning any legal actions they might have considered taking if the name had been used without their consent.\nPizza the Hutt kind of looks delicious and is described as delicious by his majordomo, so the character is likely to make viewers hungry, crave pizza specifically, and have the name of Pizza Hut planted in their minds. The character is an advertisement for Pizza Hut in a way. For all we know, Pizza Hut might have even paid the producers as a kind of product placement deal (I can't find any solid evidence one way or the other).\n\nNote that in Spaceballs there is also a Mr. Coffee coffee machine of the future that makes coffee described as \"too hot\" by a character, which is closer to damage (IMHO) than the character of Pizza the Hutt.\nInterestingly enough, since Spaceballs is a copyrighted work, if Pizza Hut created a television advertisement showing footage of Pizza the Hutt from Spaceballs, they would have to get permission to do so from the company that owns the copyrights to the movie.\nAlso note that exactly what constitutes \"damage\" or infringement in general in a legal sense is determined in the courts, not spelled out explicitly in the law. Legal precedence set by previous court cases is usually, but not always, followed by judges, but generally legal teams prefer to clear everything before a movie is released, because going through that process is a lot less expensive than even a successful defense in a court case.\n\nOne interesting and educational example of a real-world trademark dispute is the case of Apple Corps vs. Apple Computer. The companies had the same name (more or less), but in the original case, since one company made and sold computers and the other company made and sold records, it was decided that there was no trademark infringement. But Apple Computer was specifically enjoined to not get into the music business. Of course it went back to trial a few times over the subsequent years, such as when the iTunes Music Store was created.\n\n Source: https://www.upcounsel.com/what-does-a-trademark-protect \n"}, {"question": "Why do the kicks have to occur simultaneously?", "answer": "\nI love the question.\nHere's a summary from a very tight explanation (with some drawings):\nInception and Kicks\nThere were two types of dreams. The simple construct with a mild sedative and the more complex construct with a strong sedative.\nIn the simple construct, one kick is enough. Kick can be either to the self (eg: Arthur shot in the head) or a kick from above (eg: Cobb dunked in bath tub). The sedative is light so there is no synchronization required. In real life this can be equated to sleeping and dreaming about falling, the fall in the dream wakes us up. Alternately someone wakes you up by pushing you off the bed.\nIn a strong sedative, complex construct dream - a single kick is not going to be enough. A person needs two synchronized at the same instant. One kick to the self and one from the level above. The synchronization is done using music. In the real world, this can be equated to being under total anesthesia. Neither would a bad dream fall wake you up nor would pushing you off the operating table. The reel part here is that if some how pushing you off the table can be coincided with the fall in your dream, you can wake up.\nNow, in the act of inception on Fischer's mind, they are in a complex heavily sedated dream. The only viable kick here is falling because death will take you to limbo. As mentioned in another answer, waiting it out is not going to work because weeks and months would need to pass in the lower layers. Waiting it out is a possible option only in the first layer because there is limited time dilation. Also a single kick from a level above or jumping off a cliff in the current level wont work as a kick. The dreamer is far too sedated for that. A person needs to fall in the current level and the level above simultaneously so so they plan. The following kicks (falls) are planned:\nLevel 1 : Van Falling\nLevel 2 : Falling by one floor (blowing up the floor)\nLevel 3 (inception level) : Falling from the building (blowing up the structure)\nOf course, things don't go as plan. Hence they improvise on the kicks.\nHere is the set of synchronized kicks that each one receives per level of dream.\nPoint to note, no two people receive the same two kick pairs.\nHere's the image from the link:\n\n(source: thisisbarry.com)\nSo, other than dying in limbo, everything else needs a pair of synchronized kicks.

You can do a lot of research on why one is better than the other but a lot of it comes down to personal preference in the end.\nAs a Recording Medium\nThere are pros and cons for film and for digital. Some directors are sticklers for using film, particularly for quality/stylistic reasons, while others like the freedom allowed with digital media. Here are just a few of the major differences.\nDynamic range - or How pretty will it be?\nYou're going to get better whites and blacks and colors with film than with digital. The digital sensors just aren't quite sensitive enough (yet) to mimic film:\n\nThere is no limit to the number of possible levels of color on emulsion film, whereas a digital sensor stores integer numbers, producing a limited and specific possible number of colors. Banding may be visible in the unusual case that it is not obscured by noise, and detail may be lost, particularly in shadow and highlight areas.\n\nHere's an article comparing digital and film stills to show the dynamic range differences between the two... it's pretty impressive.\nHere's a summary statement on the site:\n\nIt's 2014 and when I shoot digital, I'm still using a cheap one for most things.  That's because in late 2014, even the expensive ones still blow out highlights in a nasty, computerized, unacceptable-looking way. Full-frame digital gives slightly more leeway, but it's still not slide film.\nAt least when highlights get blown out with film, they look natural.  As we've seen, Fuji Superia negative film was able to tolerate seven full stops of highlight overexposure and still yield a pleasant, smooth-looking picture.   It could be ten or twenty stops overexposed, and the worst that would happen is that it would yield a smooth-edged transition to pure white.\n\nAs to your basic question, this is the immediate answer... none of the other factors listed below are important to directors who care about this one. Film was (and is) still better in a quantifiable way, than digital.\nEverything below here is why so many opt to forgo what some consider a very minor difference between the two and make the switch to digital:\nCost - or How much do I have to fork over?\nFilm is expensive.\nWith film projects, a major cost of making is the cost of film stock (around $769 USD/roll), processing, digitizing (so that it can be edited digitally), preserving, and storing the film negatives. And, with the increasing use of digital, these costs are likely rising as fewer film-processing companies are around...  If you're interested in the costs, there's a site that outlines some of them here, not sure how recent the info is.\nThat isn't to say that digital doesn't have costs of its own... Camera cards, storage media, etc ... do have expenses associated with them.\nEase of Loss - or How much can I screw up and still get a movie out of it?\nI'm not going to say that it's impossible to screw up or lose digital files... it is... but it's not nearly as easy as screwing up a roll of undeveloped film. One little light leak and the last two hours of work is down the drain. With film, you have to train people how to properly load and unload film rolls and to particularly be wary of any light... and you have to protect those shot and un-shot rolls from the moment you buy them until they've been finished processing. Even only taking into account the time from when shot to developed and digitized, it can be a day or two... or a week before the film is truly \"safe\"... and this often requires mailing or couriering it across several states depending on if there's a processing house anywhere nearby.\nWith digital, when you pop the card out of the camera it goes to your data wrangler who will download the data and likely make multiple copies of it and verify that the files are good. Within an hour, your data is \"safe\". If you're smart and do make multiple copies of the data and keep them in different places, the chance you'll lose everything is miniscule.\nReviewing Shots - or How quickly can I see the mess the actors made of my dialogue?\nAs stated above, you don't know what you've got on film until it's developed... which can take a day to a week. Some sets may do a simultaneous recording on a digital camera but it may not record an identical image to the 35mm camera.\nDigital media can be instantly reviewed by simply watching the digital files on the camera.\nLength of Shots - or How often do I have to stop and change my media?\nA standard roll of film has a run time of about 11 minutes when run at 24 frames per second... regardless of the type of film, actually. It's the same running time for 35 mm and 16 mm, just smaller (shorter) rolls for the 16 mm. Note, this also means you have to change rolls of film every 11 minutes of shooting time!\nDepending on the digital camera used, recording quality and the size of the memory cards, you can get much more time on a digital camera.  Here's some info from the Arri Alexa's recording info page:\n\nTo paraphrase, with a 64 GB card, you'll get between 24 and 210 minutes of recording time depending on the codec you use.\nThere are other differences, obviously, but these are the big ones.\nAs a Presentation Format\nThe dynamic range issues exist here, too but the production companies have a bit more control and they're a bit more finicky about price.\nHere's some numbers from an undated article on the University of California Institute for Research in the Arts:\n\nToday, the driving force isn\u2019t so much a single movie as it is the studios\u2019 bottom line \u2014 they no longer want to pay to physically print and ship movies. It costs about $1,500 to print one copy of a movie on 35 mm film and ship it to theaters in its heavy metal canister. Multiply that by 4,000 copies \u2014 one for each movie on each screen in each multiplex around the country \u2014 and the numbers start to get ugly. By comparison, putting out a digital copy costs a mere $150.\n\nA similar amount is noted on the Wikipedia page about release prints.\n\nRelease prints are generally expensive. For example, in the United States, it is not unusual for each one to cost around $1,500 to print and ship to theaters around the country. The cost of a release print is determined primarily by its length in feet, the type of print stock used and the number of prints being struck in a given run.\n\n"}, {"question": "Why do the Avengers have bad radio discipline?", "answer": "\nYes, as you provide evidence of, they have terrible radio discipline.  Trigger discipline too. Obviously this is due to the medium, movies and comics are verbal and the film makers need you to relate to human (ish) characters in a short amount of time. Sticking to radio silence and code names would make them too stiff to like.\nThat said, only Cap, Wilson and maybe Barton fail in this respect.  They are the only traditional soldier types and would have radio discipline drilled into them. Then again. It's only really Wilson, as the rank and file soldier. Rogers spent most of his military career as a mascot capsicle, and the other half ignoring orders as a special agent. Nat is a spy, Thor is a loud boasting rage drunk, Lang a thief, Stark an egomaniac, etc.\nNotice that SHIELD agents do not have the same lack of discipline or screen time that would cinematically necessitate this informal kidding over comms.\nBut to expand, there is more to it. The Avengers have the typical comic banter type of group dynamics. Contrast Cap in the serious missions during The First Avenger. Quick action scenes, and then his solo mission at the end. Widow uses talking as a weapon, to distract and throw off guard both foe and friend. It's part of her whole M.O., unassuming power house.  Contrast Fury who tries to keep them on target.\nInterestingly enough, the most disciplined is Hulk.\n"}, {"question": "Where does the \u201cOne of us!

However, it's more likely that there just wasn't any. When the doc gets back to 1885 with broken time circuits, he first tries to fix it. When he realizes it can't be fixed, he buries the car in the mine after first draining it of all fluids.\nWhile it is unclear if the car could be dug up, it wouldn't have had any fuel. The doc would have had to keep all fluids that he drained from the car. You could argue that some gasoline could always come in handy, but as the doc mentions in his letter, he is concerned about the space time continuum. Keeping it around in his shop would be dangerous (what if someone found it?) and he wasn't going to use it in a car as he specifically forbids Marty to rescue him. To avoid disrupting space-time, the simplest thing would have been to dispose of all fuel.\nThe official explanation can be found here. Apparently the time paradox for going back into the mine was too dangerous too go back in. However, Doc could have still drained it and kept it in his shop. Either he didn't want to keep it around (for the danger of discovery) or he didn't see the point in keeping it.\n"}, {"question": "Why does Jack Nicholson say \u201cHere's Johnny!\u201d in The Shining when his character is called Jack?", "answer": "\nThat line was ad-libbed by Jack Nicholson as an imitation of Ed McMahon's intro for The Tonight Show.\nFrom here:\n\nJack Nicholson ad-libbed the line \"Here's Johnny!\" in imitation of\n  announcer Ed McMahon's famous introduction of Johnny Carson on U.S.\n  network NBC-TV's long-running late night television program The\n  Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

(To compare, Monica's grandmother's apartment, rent-controlled since the '40s, could have been about $200.) Split two ways between Chandler and Joey for three years, as stated in the episode, the total is: $63,000\nWe know utilities weren't included in their rent, so we'll follow user ASmileThatKills' lead and calculate Joey's half at $1,000.\n\nTotal so far: $64,000\nNow for food. ASmileThatKills tries to guesstimate the amount Joey, known for his love of eating, spends on food every week\u2014or rather the amount Chandler spends covering him. ASmileThatKills speculates the total is \"$100 a week on groceries + $100 a week on pizza/takeout/coffee + $50 a week for Joey's dates, every week for 3 years.\" So that\u2019s $5,200 annually for groceries. \nJoey went on a lot of dates, and this is Manhattan. Let's bump it up to $75, so $3,900 yearly. And since we all saw how much coffee those poor kids drank, let\u2019s tack an extra $15/week onto the takeout total, or $5,980. That brings the three-year total for food costs up to $45,240.\nTotal so far: $109,240\nBut wait, there's a lot more:\n\nTwo sets of acting resume head shots, $500 each: $1,000\nDiscounting inflation, Joey\u2019s half of the phone and cable bills would have been around $35/month. Plus, if we assume that Chandler didn\u2019t want to have to fight Joey for the phone when Joey was using their dial-up Internet, then they probably had another separate phone line for their computers, so an additional $10 for Joey: $1,620\nIn season 4, episode 2, Joey is responsible for all of their apartment furniture getting stolen. Yikes! [...] ASmileThatKills estimates this total cost at roughly $5,500.\nIn season 6, episode 18, Chandler mentions that Joey owes him $3,400.\n\nThe grand total: $120,760\n\nBut of course, this is all trivia and not the official amount disclosed. \nAnd so as Joey says, \"it's a MOO point\" ;)\n"}, {"question": "Why is Pulp Fiction's opening scene different to the one near the end?", "answer": "\nIt clearly looks like a continuity error, but if IMDb's Pulp Fiction FAQ page is to be believed:\n\nWhy is what Yolanda says in the beginning different from what she says at the end?\nTarantino has explained that this is not an error, rather, he did this on purpose. When we first examine the scene, we are seeing Ringo and Yolanda's conversation from their perspective. Obviously, because this is their conversation, what we hear first is probably what was actually said. However, at the end of the film, what is said is different because we are no longer viewing the situation from Ringo and Yolanda's perspective, but rather everyone else in the diner, most specifically Jules.\n\nSo it is claimed that, in effect, this was done intentionally to further punctuate Pulp Fiction's disjointed, non-linear narrative with a Rashomon-inspired scene as presented from different perspectives (so it's simply remembered differently).\n"}, {"question": "Is this an inconsistency in the Infinity War and Guardians of the Galaxy?", "answer": "\nThe destruction of the Zehoberei people may have come long after Thanos' attack on the planet.

One example quote taken from IMDB:\n\nI was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five years old. Hard to believe. My grandfather was a lawman; father too. Me and him was sheriffs at the same time; him up in Plano and me out here. I think he's pretty proud of that. I know I was. Some of the old time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lotta folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough'd never carried one; that's the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one up in Comanche County. I always liked to hear about the oldtimers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would have operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. \"Be there in about fifteen minutes\". I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He'd have to say, \"O.K., I'll be part of this world.\"\n\nEven though Sheriff Ed Tom Bell doesn't appear on screen very often (compared to Chigur and Moss), he is the narrator and the protagonist of the movie. So, the title refers to the moral decline that gave birth to evil (Chigur) and depraved (Moss) individuals and made modern society unsuitable for \"oldtimers\".\nSome links:\n\nWikipedia page on themes and analysis of the movie has a nice set of references\nThe novel itself took the title from a poem Sailing to Byzantium (That is no country for old men...)\n\n"}, {"question": "The most actors playing the same role in one movie?", "answer": "\nThere's a wiki article on this too - List of characters played by multiple actors in the same film\nThe highest film I can find that definitely meets the requirement is:\nPalindromes - eight actors playing one role:\nAll of the below actors play Aviva\n\nEmani Sledge, Valerie Shusterov, Hannah Freiman, Rachel Corr, Will\n  Denton, Sharon Wilkins, Shayna Levine and Jennifer Jason Leigh as\n  Aviva in Palindromes (2004)\n\nHowever, if we accept a slightly more unusual film:\nAudition - 50 actors playing one role, 50 actresses playing the other role\nThis may seem like a bit of a cheat, but as you asked for movie characters, the following all play Man:\n\nNicholas Baroudi, Bryant Boon, Grant Boyd, Tyler Burke, Sean Buttimer,\n  Nicholas E.

Conversely, it's also possible that he'd never discover another single one..\nSimilarly, if Thanos were to look into the future, then, it's easily possible that he might not discover a future that leads to his doom until his 4 billionth trace of the future; maybe even 4 trillionth!\nGiven that there are literally an infinite number of \"branches\" that occur when searching through the future, really, Dr. Strange was extremely lucky to find a winning future in just 14 million searches.\n\nAt the same time, perhaps Thanos just doesn't have a motivation to do such a thing -- he's just obtained the six most powerful objects in the universe, is now the most powerful being himself, and, has just accomplished his ultimate goal.\n\n\nMy point is that is can Thanos override Dr. Strange's \"Future\"?\n\nIf he's able to find the exact same future that Dr. Strange saw, then, maybe it's possible, but maybe it's not.\nThis kind of topic usually invokes paradoxical arguments, etc., so I won't get into all that, but, in general, perhaps some futures can't be changed, regardless of a character's efforts to avoid it?\nA classic example of this kind of story (where the character is aware of their future, makes an active attempt to avoid it, but by doing so actually fulfills their destiny) is the Greek tragedy of Oedipus Rex.\n"}, {"question": "Where are Frodo, Gandalf and the others going at the end and why?", "answer": "\nFrodo leaves Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond, Celeborn, and Galadriel.\nThis is considered a mystical land, home to the Valar, 'angelic' beings, also known as the 'masters of spirits'.\nFrom the LotR wiki: \n\nIn TA 3021 (Third Age), C\u00edrdan the Shipwright accompanied Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the Undying Lands, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, Hobbits who were among the very few mortal beings to be allowed passage to the Undying Lands.\n  Eventually, Samwise Gamgee, another Hobbit of the Shire, and the Dwarf Gimli along with his good friend Legolas, are also said to have made the journey.\n\nNow, as to why they made the journey, there seems to only be speculation, although the most common agreement is that Tolkien chose to have his beloved characters travel there, seemingly to remain, in order for them to live forever.\nEDIT: It has been pointed out that, as mortals, eternal life would not be an option for the hobbits, so perhaps we should consider it more of a happy retirement.\nAnother, more thorough, answer could be the following, from Yahoo:\n\nHis [Frodo's] journey to Mordor had scarred him, physically and emotionally. He would never fully heal. Arwen gave him her seat on the last ship (the only thing of note she ever did in the whole danged book) so that he could find rest. All of the ring bearers left Middle-earth; Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond, Bilbo, Frodo, and even Sam after his children were grown and Rosie passed away.\n\n"}, {"question": "Why is it Pet Sematary but not Pet Cemetery?", "answer": "\nPet Sematary is based on the novel of the same name.

The children had misspelled the name when it was created.\nQuoting the Stephen King novel:\n...It narrowed, and then, just ahead, Louis saw Ellie and Jud go under an arch made of weatherstained boards. Written on these in faded black paint, only just legible, were the words PET SEMATARY.\n"}, {"question": "What media format do TV stations use?", "answer": "\nTL;DR\nWhile it varies from station to station, it is common to receive or ingest the footage by receiving on satellite and recording it for later usage.\nWhere possible, the TV station will accept the media files from the production house or a distribution service directly. In this case, the media is usually in the MXF or MOV file formats.\nThe resolution is usually 1280x720 or 1920x1080, with a higher bit-rate ranging between 30 and 100 Mbps.\nThe only major difference between the consumer deliverable and the format the station has is the bit-rate. The TV station has equipment that can handle the larger files, and has a larger data storage capacity than most normal households. However, a well encoded Blu-ray will contain a close copy of the file the station receives, with an encoded bit-rate between 15 and 45 Mbps.\nThe main reason for the difference is bandwidth. One 24 minute episode at a bit rate of 145 Mbps stored in uncompressed MXF can be as large as 29 GB. Unfortunately, that has to be compressed in order to get it out to the millions of people that TV stations service.\n\nThere isn't an established format that all TV stations receive. It largely depends on the format that can be provided to the station, and what the station is setup to accept regarding equipment.\nAs Scotty Parker mentioned, a lot of the content is ingested into the studio via satellite. meaning, it's simply recorded as it's airing, like a fancy DVR and a dish that's bigger than average. When this is the case, the recorded format is usually as high as it can be, which is hopefully in most cases HD at 1280x720, or FHD at 1920x1080.\nHowever, an increasingly large number of stations use content that is acquired directly from the production house. Meaning that the company who produced and/or edited the show will provide the media directly to the station airing it. In many cases this is a very high bit-rate, high resolution file. Something akin to Avid's DNxHD format (such as DNxHD145 or 175), or Apple ProRes, or Sony's XDCAM. But despite the higher-than-average bitrate of the file, the resolution is rarely anything higher than 1080p.\nUnless you're the editor, and you'd be working with a 1080p file at a bit-rate of 145 or 175 Mbps.\nBut these formats are not secret, or kept from the general public. You can have the same formats TV stations use.\nFor example: File based workflows (where the production house turns over the raw media directly), the file would most likely be in the MOV or MXF formats. These files are normally encoded at a bit rate of somewhere between 30 and 50 Mbps (hopefully), and a have resolution between 720 and 1080.\nNeither of these file types are hard to come by, and in fact, the MXF file type is listed as a SMPTE standard (SMPTE 377M). But how convenient would it be to sell you a show and make you download a 28GB file or a 32GB USB drive with a single episode of Game of Thrones? \nSo, it's made available to everybody in a compressed, but still very high quality format: Blu-ray.\nThese Blu-ray's are normally encoded at a 15-30 Mbit bit-rate, which although less than the raw MXF, is still very high.\nOr you could download a slightly more compressed version from some website, or a streaming/OTT service (Apple TV, Netflix, etc).\nSource: I work at a TV station.\n"}, {"question": "Why are two of Riley's five emotions in Inside Out male?", "answer": "\nDirector Pete Docter and Pixar founder John Lasseter explain why Riley's emotions are mixed while her parents' are not.\nFirst, the parents' emotions are due to both emotional development and story and acting flow:\n\nI [Docter] remember, we talked to John and he said, \u2018Well, I thought you did it because, as adults, we become more kind of set in our ways. As a kid, you can... anywhere is possible.\u2019\nDocter said that they were ultimately two things that were absolutely vital to the scene: clarity and comedy. Had Riley\u2019s parents both had multi-gendered emotions like their daughter, the scene would have been going back between 18 different characters, and it was a bit unruly unless everyone was identifiable. Not only did making the emotions gender specific in the parents make the sequence easier to follow, but it also opened up an opportunity to create a few extra laughs.  Explained the director: \nFor the comedy of it, we\u2019re cutting between 18 characters and 4 locations in that dinner scene, so we just went broad with it - kind of how SNL would do it. They all have like dopey obvious mustaches or big red glasses so that you\u2019re instantly clear on, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s mom; it\u2019s dad.\u2019 http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Inside-Out-Main-Character-Has-Male-Female-Emotions-72176.html\n\nSo the parents are simplified to make the scene easier to follow, and because as Adults, they have already developed their adult personality/emotions. Riley has not yet.\n\nInterviewer: What was the thought process behind the genders of the emotions?\nDocter: Again, it was intuitive. It felt to me like Anger's very masculine, I don't know why. And then some of it came to casting... Sadness felt a little more feminine and Mindy Kahling as Disgust felt right. And someone balanced too. Plus the female roles lead because it's inside a girl. With mom and dad, we skewed them all male and all female for a quick read, because you have to understand where we are, which is a little phony but hopefully people don't mind! http://www.empireonline.com/empireblogs/empire-states/post/p1463\n\nSo in short, Riley's emotions are mixed because, as a pre-teen, she's likely not to have developed a strict outer personality. She's still growing, and developing her own style. She's still raw and malleable, impressionable. Secondary to this is of course the rule of funny. Having some of the emotions as male is purely for show.\n"}, {"question": "How did the T-Rex reach the vehicles in Jurassic Park?", "answer": "\nAs explained on the Jurassic Park Wikia, there is a hill side drop to the left of the cars:\n\nOften incorrectly regarded as a goof is the fact that when the Tyrannosaurus exits her paddock from ground level with the road, there's the sudden appearance of a cliff when she pushes the car over it.

The diagram on the right illustrates what happens.\n\n\n"}, {"question": "How much of Star Wars did George Lucas actually write?", "answer": "\nAt the risk of giving an opinion-based answer, your friend is mostly right. Lucas began by writing a synopsis of the story in early 1973, then started working on a rough draft of a script the next year. Lucas' first draft was a mess: the story was confusing, far too long, and incredibly boring; the characters were terrible and bland; the dialogue was leaden and stilted; etc.  He eventually produced at least 6 versions of the script (first/rough draft, second draft, third draft, then 3 different versions of the fourth draft), and he had lots of help during the revision process.\nIn Lucas' own words in an article from Mediascene Prevue #42, 1980:\n\nI think [I came up with the title The Star Wars before the story]. When I made the deal, I had to give it a name. I had been making notes, doing research over the years, but it wasn\u2019t until I finished American Graffiti in \u201973 that I actually started writing it. My original 14-page treatment didn\u2019t bear much relationship to the final production, though.\n\nFrom a site on the development of Star Wars:\n\n[In the first synopsis,] the story was very confusing and the spelling was horrible, since Lucas had never learned proper spelling or punctuation.  His agent and lawyer were puzzled and did not understand the story, and it was actually due to the popularity of American Graffiti that they eventually managed to sell the film to Twentieth Century Fox\u2014after it had been rejected by both United Artists and Universal Pictures.\nA rough [draft] was completed one year later in May 1974, and still carried the title The Star Wars. It was the first of four major drafts and several revised versions... When the screenplay draft was finished, however, Lucas still thought it was a mess.\nThe Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One): \u201cThe Star Wars\u201d was the title of Lucas\u2019s second draft which was delivered on January 28, 1975. This was a more character-driven story with more character development, which was important since Lucas wanted the film to make an emotional impact... He let his friends (among them director Francis Ford Coppola) read the scripts and tape-recorded their comments in order to get some advice. However, the suggestions from his wife Marcia (a film editor who later won an Oscar for Star Wars) were the ones he took most seriously, even though her criticism sometimes made him angry.\nThe third [draft] which was finished on August 1, 1975 was called The Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller, and by this time, most of the plot was established. Lucas felt quite comfortable with his characters, but he still thought that the dialogue needed improvement, and was very concerned that his story might never make it to the silver screen.\nLucas\u2019s revised fourth draft was the one which was used when filming began in Tunisia on March 25, 1976. A slightly edited version of this draft, entitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\u2014From the Journal of the Whills, was published in 1979 as the official screenplay of the film (the final editing of that public version [of the fourth draft]\u2014erroneously dated to January 15, 1976\u2014was done after Star Wars went into production, probably after the film\u2019s May 1977 release). \nLucas had consulted his co-writers from American Graffiti (Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz) to sharpen the dialogue, which he felt lacked humour and bounce, and although he rejected most of what they came up with, their new ideas gave Lucas renewed confidence in his work. \n\nRegarding A New  Hope:\nLucas later commented on the contributions of Huyck and Katz, in the book Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays:  \n\nDialogue has never been my strong point, and so I talked to Willard and Gloria and asked them to do a quick dialogue polish. I gave them the fourth draft of the script, and they just improved the dialogue where they felt they could make a contribution. Then I took their changes, and sometimes I rewrote some of their lines. Some of their dialogue of course changed again when we started shooting. Some of it survived; some of it didn\u2019t. They did about thirty percent of the dialogue.\n\nThe cast agreed with Lucas' assessment of his dialogue-related shortcomings.  Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and others frequently teased Lucas about this, and it is touched upon in audio commentary tracks and making-of documentaries. Harrison Ford was particularly outspoken, and his difficulties with Lucas' dialogue led him to improvise many of his lines in the series.\n\nFord famously told George Lucas, concerning the clunky dialogue in \"Star Wars,\" \"George, you can type this shit, but you sure as hell can't say it.\" \n\nHarrison Ford later confirmed this:\n\n\"I told George: 'You can't say that stuff. You can only type it.'\"\n\nRegarding Ford's improvisation:\n\nMark Hamill, for one, was amazed at the dedication Ford put into each and every line, stating, \"He'd written things in the margins, saying the same thing basically, but his way. He had an amazing way of keeping the meaning but doing it in a really unique way for his character.\" \n\nA George Lucas quote from Denise Worrell\u2019s book Icons (1989): \n\nThere are four or five scripts for Star Wars, and you can see as you flip through them where certain ideas germinated and how the story developed. There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now. But by the time I finished the first Star Wars, the basic ideas and plots for Empire and Jedi were also done. As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them; I\u2019d put them aside in notebooks. As I was writing Star Wars, I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday. It was a mind trip I laid on myself to get me through the script. I just kept taking out stuff, and finally with Star Wars I felt I had one little incident that introduced the characters. So for the last six years [1977-1983] I\u2019ve been trying to get rid of all the ideas I generated and felt so bad about throwing out in the first place.\n\nRegarding Empire Strikes Back:\nGeorge Lucas quote from Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays: \n\nWriting has never been something I have enjoyed, and so, ultimately, on the second film I hired Leigh Brackett. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out; she turned in the first draft, and then she passed away. I didn\u2019t like the first script, but I gave Leigh credit because I liked her a lot. She was sick at the time she wrote the script, and she really tried her best. During the story conferences I had with Leigh, my thoughts weren\u2019t fully formed and I felt that her script went in a completely different direction.\n\nA George Lucas quote from Alan Arnold\u2019s book Once Upon A Galaxy\n\nI hired Leigh Brackett to write the screenplay, but tragically she died right after completing the first draft. Faced with the situation that somebody had to step in and do a rewrite, I was forced to write the second draft of this screenplay. But I found it much easier than I\u2019d expected, almost enjoyable. It still took me three months to do, but that\u2019s a lot different from two years. I also had the advantage of Larry Kasdan coming in later to do a rewrite and fix it up.  \n\nLawrence Kasdan quote from Cinefantastique Vol. 28: \n\nWhat I worked on was a draft of the script George had written, based on the story George had given to Leigh [Brackett]. I don\u2019t know what of Leigh\u2019s draft survived into the draft George wrote. What George handed me was a very rough first draft, really somewhere between an outline and a first draft. The structure of the story was all there \u2013 it was the skeleton for a movie. What was needed was the flesh and the muscle.\u201d   \n\nRegarding Return of the Jedi (originally titled \"Return of the Jedi\" in early pre-production, retitled \"Revenge of the Jedi\" just before filming began, kept this title until 4 months before the film was released, when Lucas finally, officially changed the title back to \"Return of the Jedi\"):  \nLawrence Kasdan quote from Starlog #51 (October 1981): \n\n[Kasdan is working from a] very rough first draft [script that George Lucas wrote. Kasdan will have to write Revenge of the Jedi quickly, since it begins shooting in January.] It\u2019s a similar situation to the terrible time problem we had on Empire, but I think that this time I\u2019ll have a much freer hand, because the Jedi screenplay that George gave me isn\u2019t nearly as far along as Empire\u2019s was.\n\nRobert Watts quote from The Making of Return of the Jedi: \n\nThe screenplay is the blueprint for everything, and without it you tend to flounder a bit. We\u2019d had indications, we\u2019d had discussions, we\u2019d had drafts, but the final script did come very, very late.\n\n\nThe drafts of the A New Hope script:\nHere is the first (rough) draft, from the invaluable Jedi Bendu Script Site.\nHere is the second draft, from the same site.\nHere is the third draft, from the same site.\nFourth draft, same site. \nRevised fourth draft, same site.\nPublic version of fourth draft, same site.\nAnalyses and summaries of the drafts/scripts:\nThe Connoisseur\u2019s Guide to the Scripts of the Star Wars Saga, same site.\nThe Development of Star Wars, As Seen Through the Scripts by George Lucas, from site  referred to earlier.\nThe Jedi Bendu Script Site also has articles on the draft variations for Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. \n\nSome of the more glaring differences between the early drafts of the script for A New Hope and the finished movie(s):\nFirst synopsis:\n\nInterestingly, the first line of the synopsis is:\n\nThis is the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi Bendu of Ophuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, Padawaan learner of the famed Jedi.\n\nLucas explained that he originally intended for the events of the film to be presented as though they were recorded in a journal (\"The Journal of the Whills\") by an uninvolved narrator - apparently, this narrator was supposed to be a Jedi named Mace Windu. \nLucas' own words regarding the \"Journal of the Whills\" concept:\n\nOriginally, I was trying to have the story be told by somebody else; there was somebody watching this whole story and recording it, somebody probably wiser than the mortal players in the actual events. I eventually dropped this idea, and the concepts behind the Whills turned into the Force. But the Whills became part of this massive amount of notes, quotes, background information that I used for the scripts; the stories were actually taken from the \u2018Journal of the Whills\u2019 \n\n\nFirst Draft:\n\nThere is a Luke Skywalker, but he is nothing like our Luke Skywalker - he is a Jedi General who looks to be in his 60's but is actually much older - so we'll ignore him completely in this summary.  The character most like the one we know as Luke Skywalker was originally named Annikin Starkiller.\nThe heroes are Kane Starkiller and his sons Annikin and Deak.  Kane is a Jedi, one of the last, and is training his sons to become Jedi.\nVader, obviously, is not Annikin, nor is he the father of the Annikin/Luke character.\nInstead of a mask and helmet, Vader's face is covered by a black silk scarf.\nVader is a general, not a Jedi (in fact, he doesn't even believe that Jedi exist), wears a normal uniform, and dies aboard the Death Star \nAlmost everyone uses a lightsaber - even Stormtroopers. Lightsabers are at least as common as blasters (imagine how much less awesome Jedi would be if their unique and iconic weapons weren't unique or iconic at all).\nWhat we know as the Dark Side of the Force is instead called the \"Bogan Force\" or \"para-Force\"; what we know as the Light Side of the Force is called the \"Ashla Force\";  what we know as the Force is called the \"Force of Others\".  The Jedi are referred to as \"Jedi Bendu\".  The standard Jedi Bendu way of saying goodbye is \"May the Force of Others be with you\".\nThe first movie focuses on Kane Starkiller, the leader of the Alliance, sending his sons on a mission to retrieve the \"Kiber Crystal\" from a man named Owen Lars (who isn't Annikin's/Luke's uncle).  The Kiber Crystal is a diamond-like gem that can magnify either side of the Force a hundredfold.  Kane intends to use it to destroy the Death Star.\nHan Solo was originally a lizard-like creature with gills, an idea Lucas fortunately dropped by the time he wrote the second draft.\nChewbacca wears clothes - specifically, a flak jacket and brown cargo shorts (as well as his trademark bandoliers.\nLeia is 14, and instead of being Annikin/Luke's sister, she falls in love with him.  Biggs is her little brother.\nGrande Mouff Tarkin isn't a bad guy, nor an Imperial official, just a wimp.\nThe description of Wookiees (spelled \"Wookees\" in the first draft) is worth mentioning:  They are huge, gray, and furry, with large yellow eyes. They resemble giant bush-babies or lemurs.  They can squawk, jabber, yell, scream, laugh, screech, chatter, and cheer. They hug and kiss to show affection, and kneel and bow to show respect.     \n\nSecond Draft:\n\nIn the second draft, Luke is much more like the Luke we know.  Here is how the Jedi Bendu site's summary of the second draft describes the manner in which we first encounter Luke: \n\nThe two droids... find the Moisture Farm of Owen Lars. The farm houses Owen\u2019s wife, Beru, and Lars\u2019 sixteen year old daughter, Leia. Also living there are Luke Starkiller, who is short and a little chubby, and Luke\u2019s younger brothers Biggs and Windy Starkiller. Luke likes to study fossils in the Dune Sea when he is not practicing with his lazersword [\"lazersword\" was Lucas' unimaginative original name for the lightsaber].\n\nLuke's father is dead.\nLuke and his mother lived with Owen Lars, Owen's wife Beru, and their daughter Leia on the Lars family's moisture farm; Luke's mother died some time later.  Leia therefore grew up living with Luke, who is about 2 years older than her, and she has a crush on him.  She is clearly not a princess, nor is she his birth sister.\nIn this draft, Owen has enthusiastically tried to teach Luke to become a warrior (presumably of the Jedi variety), but Luke shows little interest in anything other than lazersword practice and digging for fossils.  This is effectively the opposite of the Owen/Luke dynamic we see in the finished movie. \nIn the second draft, instead of Annikin and Deak using the Kiber Crystal to destroy the Death Star (the version of events in the first draft), Luke flies his attack ship towards a familiar exhaust port on the battle station's surface. Vader pursues him in a fighter craft and is about to fire his weapons at Luke's ship, when out of nowhere, Han Solo's ship appears and blasts Vader's fighter out of the battle.  Luke focuses on his task, steering his ship towards the small exhaust hole ahead, then...  C-3PO FIRES THE TORPEDOES INTO THE PORT, DESTROYING THE DEATH STAR.  You read that right - the torpedo that destroys the Death Star is fired not by Luke himself, but by his gunner - C-3PO. \nObi Wan/Ben Kenobi does not appear in either the first or the second draft.  He was a later addition.  Even after he was added, he was supposed to survive the first two films.  When filming for A New Hope was more than half over, Lucas decided to kill him off to add a sense of drama.  Since Obi Wan was supposed to be the one who continued Luke's training in the second film, now that he was dead Lucas needed someone else to train Luke.  This is how Yoda came about.  Incidentally, Sir Alec Guinness was less than happy about suddenly finding out that the script had been changed and his character was being killed off.\nAlthough this applies to The Empire Strikes Back, not A New Hope, I have to mention it here: Yoda was originally named \"Minch\". He was fairly harsh, and refused to let Luke eat until his training was complete.   \nLucas claims that by the time A New Hope was released, the idea that Vader is Luke's father was set in stone.  The early drafts of the Empire Strikes Back script, however, seem to contradict this.  It seems more likely that this idea only occurred to Lucas well after filming for Empire had begun.  The same may be true of the idea that Luke and Leia are brother and sister.\n\n"}, {"question": "Why have this character involved in Infinity War at all?", "answer": "\nThis is answered by Russo brothers themselves:\n\nWhat was the decision making process to bring Red Skull back?\nJoe Russo: Somebody had to be the gatekeeper to the Soul Stone and\nsomebody had to distribute the rules to Thanos and Gamora.\nAnthony Russo: In a way that was credible and believable.\nJoe Russo: Who felt credible to the audience.

From Wikipedia:\n\nUb Iwerks designed Mickey's body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate. Disney employees John Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences. Mickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears, which in traditional animation, always appear circular no matter which way Mickey faces. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. Even today, the rudimentary symbol Mickey Mouse is often used to represent Mickey (see Hidden Mickey). This later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey. In animation in the 1940s Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective.\n\nThis unrealistic depiction is so iconic, it was even replicated somehow in 3d later on. Says John Ford, one of the animators of the video game Epic Mickey:\n\nWe did some tests with Mickey without ears that were facing the camera and it just didn\u2019t hold up,\u201d said John Ford, one of the animators at Junction Point, \u201cso we decided to go with the facing ears. We had some really smart programmers write code that would always make sure that, no matter which way Mickey was facing, you would have ears that not only faced the camera correctly but also oriented correctly on his head\".\n\nIn the end, cartoons aren't exactly about realism but about expression. As animator Richard Williams says in his book The Animator's Survival Kit:\n\nGood drawing is not copying the surface. It has to do with understanding and expression. We don\u2019t want to learn to draw just to end up being imprisoned in showing off our knowledge of joints and muscles. We want to get the kind of reality that a camera can\u2019t get. [...]\nMany cartoonists and animators say that the very reason they do cartoons is to get away from realism and the realistic world into the free realms of the imagination. They\u2019ll correctly point out that most cartoon animals don\u2019t look like animals - they\u2019re designs, mental constructs.\n\nHere's an example of a more realistic perspective approach in the 40s that was eventually scrapped:\n\n"}, {"question": "What was the purpose of Candie's handshake in Django Unchained?", "answer": "\nI believe it is to be interpreted as \"getting the last laugh\", \"getting one up\", or \"getting the better\" of the other person.

This is why Cobb is wary of inception in the first place.\nEDIT: As onewho correctly points out, Mal also has every reason not to believe her totem anymore because it's what Cobb used for her inception when he spinned it inside her safe. So the byproduct of the concept 'your world is not real' might be 'and your totem has been tampered with'.\nUltimately, this was the problem with Mal's inception. It was predicated on manipulation, which led only to doubt and mistrust.

In the DVD commentary for Dead Man's Chest, the writers explain that the Pelegostos are the tribe who made Jack their chief\u2014that is, they invented a backstory for Depp's joke for the purposes of the new movie.\nSo Jack didn't have to become that important in the limited time he spends offscreen in Dead Man's Chest; he already was their chief, and this was his triumphant return! This also helps to explain how Gibbs already knows about the religious traditions of the Pelegostos: Presumably they had attempted to release Jack from his fleshy prison during his first visit.\nBut why would Jack return to an island where the natives want to kill him, and how did he get there so fast? I suspect both questions have the same answer: The island of the Pelegostos happened to be the nearest place that was safe from the Kraken. Jack knew where the island was, he knew that the natives would be friendly (at least initially), and although he knew of the danger, in typical Jack Sparrow style he assumed he would escape somehow.\n"}, {"question": "Why does \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d use an image language associated with national socialism for the First Order?", "answer": "\nIt isn't just in The Force Awakens that this is the case.

The \"Wakefield\" story features a colder, bluer tone to match the sad, depressive emotion. The \"Ayala\" story is bright, shiny, and saturated in primary colors, especially red, to match the glitzy surface of Helena's life. The \"Mexican\" story appears grainy, rough, and hot to go with the rugged Mexican landscape and congested cities. \n\nFilm processing (or digital processing filters) is often used in films to convey mood/heat/other emotions.  This is all that's in play here.\nMexico is often viewed as being hot and claustrophobic - the film treatment here (and in other films) uses this to enhance the mood of the film.\nAdditionally,\nSoderbergh's rationale for differing colour temperatures and grain effects in different strands of the story of \"Traffic\" can easily to be applied to other directors and films.  Directors can and do use film treatments, editing styles, and music in order to enhance the emotional impacts of scenes, characters, events, and entire films.\nIt's outside the scope of this answer to include exhaustive examples.  However, the main point of this answer is that directors aren't likely to apply film treatements in order to convey a stereotypical perception of any particular location, although this may occasionally be the case.\n"}, {"question": "How did Murph know about Edmunds?", "answer": "\nThe only way Murph could know is when that information came from Brand herself.

Originally, a frame was inserted once every 16 frames (16 frames per foot for 35mm film) with numbers marked 11 to 3.  At some point in the mid 1960's that was changed to a continuous countdown with a new number every second (time interval as opposed to length interval) that ran backwards from 8 to 2.  If you google \"Film Leader Countdown\", you should be able to find a number of examples on YouTube and Vimeo.\nThe purpose of this was to assist in the threading of projectors.\nThe woman you speak of is referred to as a \"China Girl\".

One of my favourite films is the Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Not only does the camera spend much of the movie trained on Billy Bob Thornton's face - so much of his work in that film involves subtle, almost imperceptible changes in facial expressions and eye movements - it's really a good example of something that couldn't and wouldn't have been done that way many decades ago.\nI recently watched an old Hitchcock film starring a young Paul Newman (Torn Curtain, 1966). He stood out from other cast members on that movie as he was already developing a much more \"modern\" acting style. It was a good exercise in the contrast.\nRegarding sound effects: early on, American and British film and TV were very similar, but America soon started using a much more developed system of foley which the British didn't bother with for some time. Even today, American film and TV have a much more complete foley approach (having created the role of foley artist, based in the work of Jack Foley).  Extensive foley work gives a much greater control over the sound of final product, just as post production effects give control over the image.\nAlong the way, you notice the refining of the foley presence and process (just as you do with post-production effects); it's much more heavy-handed before it settled down into a streamlined and nuanced process. You can read about the origins of foley here, and the more general history of its development here.\nAs for speech in film, you'll notice changes over time: there is the speed of their speech. In early periods of film, the cultural perception was that rapid delivery evinced certainty and confidence, and as an extra bonus, a lot of speech covered up lacks in sound effects or the presence of too much background noise (dialogue was harder to isolate with older technology). \nAnd as others have said, the accent often used in earlier American films is the Mid-Atlantic or Trans-Atlantic accent, which was \"a consciously learned blend of American English and British English, intended to favor neither.\" While this attempt to use an accent acceptable to either the British or American ear has fallen by the wayside in favour of the actual American vernacular, the tendency still exists in a small way, like when Canadians adjust their accent to sound neither specifically Canadian nor American, or when actors from my part of the world adjust how they speak to sound neither distinctly like an Australian or a New Zealander, for example.\n"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of taxi-cabs and buses in Pixar\u2019s 'Cars 2' movie?", "answer": "\nWithin the logic of Cars, buses act as mobile billboards, as well as providing guided tours of London\n\nI love the detail in our films.

For example, others have implied the 70mm and IMAX are the same thing.  While it's true IMAX does project from 70mm prints, 70mm prints are used in a variety of other, non-IMAX formats.\nBefore the switch to digital, most commercial movies were shot on 35mm negatives and then distributed to theaters as 35mm or sometimes 70mm prints.  (Yes, some 70mm prints are sometimes made from 35mm masters.)\nA few big budget, \"big screen\" movies were sometimes shot in 70mm and distributed to big theaters on 70mm prints and smaller theaters on 35mm prints.\nThe sizes, 35mm and 70mm, refer to the width of the film itself.  This width includes the room for the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Some digital audio tracks use the spaces between the sprocket holes.  I believe (but correct me if I'm wrong) that magnetic audio tracks are not included in that width.\nMost film runs through the projector vertically (big exceptions are true IMAX and VistaVision), so the width the frame is limited by the width of the film minus the width of the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Thus the width of a frame on a 35mm print is a bit narrower than 35mm.\nThe sprocket holes are often called \"perfs,\" and many formats are thus referred to as a number of \"perfs.\"  That is, as the number of sprocket holes from one frame to the next.  A typical frame size for 35mm prints is 4-perf.  Thus the height of the frame was limited by that number.  For 70mm, I believe common formats were 7-perf, but I don't have a source for that.\nThe aspect ratio is the ratio of the width to the height.  In olden times, movies were pretty square, much like old television sets.  To compete with television, the studios introduced different aspect ratios (typically wider) in order to make the movie experience seem more immersive than television.\nGiven that the width and height of the frame both have upper bounds, there are only a few ways to adjust the aspect ratio:\n\nUse less than the full height available on the frame, and use a telephoto projection lens to compensate for the diminished height.\nShoot (or print) the frames with an anamorphic lens that squishes the image horizontally to fit it onto the film, then project with the complementary lens that stretches it back out.  This is typically done for the widest of wide-screen formats.  A telltale artifact is that lens flares appear as ovals rather than circles.\nRun the film horizontally.  The height is limited by the film size minus sprocket holes, and the width is limited by however many perfs you choose.  This is what traditional IMAX does.  (Traditional IMAX also uses 70mm film exclusively.)\n\nGiven identical aspect ratios, 70mm film gives far more area per frame, which means it can be projected larger or will have better clarity and detail when projected as the same size as a comparable 35mm print.\nSome movies are shot in a variety of formats, but mastered into a common format during editing and post production.  For example, the original Star Wars films used old VistaVision cameras for many of the motion-controlled model shots, even though everything else was probably shot with traditional cameras that ran the film vertically.\nIn the case of this Tarantino film, I suspect it was shot on 70mm using anamorphic lenses in order to make a super-widescreen.  IMDB confirms.\n"}, {"question": "Why didn't Bane reveal to the public that Bruce Wayne is Batman?", "answer": "\nIn the movie Bane was trying to cause chaos in the city by pitting the rich against the poor.

Really. Even when they are intelligent. Even when they know it's fake, canned laughter. I know this is hard to believe, but behavioural psychologists have run the tests, and the results are unambiguous: laugh tracks work, no matter how informed or intelligent the audience is. (Only have pop-sci books as sources for that, ask on Cognitive Science if you want the primary sources.)\nAs for why some shows do it and others don't: fundamentally, people who find a program funnier are more likely to keep watching, ergo more ad dollars. The downside is that some people might find the laugh track offensive and not watch out of spite. Clearly different producers have different expectations of which effect will predominate, which leads to different choices; the production cost of adding laugh tracks is rather small, and probably not decisive.\n"}, {"question": "What does the scene during the ending represent?", "answer": "\nPer director Stanley Kubrick:\n\nThe ballroom photograph at the very end suggests the reincarnation of Jack.\n\nHow does it relate to the movie?\nIt sort of echoes the \"You\u2019ve always been the caretaker.\" line earlier in the film, which suggests something along the lines that his soul is perpetually stuck at/destined to end up at that hotel.\n"}, {"question": "Is the man with no name the same character?", "answer": "\nFor me he is not.\nYet I don't have a hard proof either. But until we get some definite affirmation or denial from Sergio Leone or anyone else acquainted with the project, let's take a look at what in particular might speak for the theory of him being the same character in all the movies:\n\nThey are commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy (or sometimes \"Man with No Name\" Trilogy) and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is considered a prequel to the \"Dollars\"-movies. But as your question already says, this argument is easily annihilated by the fact that those movies were not intended as a trilogy initially, but this was rather a marketing decision developed after the fact by the American distributor. So not a trilogy but maybe still the same character?\n\nApart from the same director, with Clint Eastwood they share the same actor in all the movies. But they share even more actors in major roles, like Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 or Lee Van Cleef, yet I doubt Col. Mortimer would be considered to be the same character as Sentenza (The Bad). And, as you said yourself, Clint's character is, while not having much of an actual name, referred to by different nicknames in the individual movies.\n\nThen we still have the very strong argument that his character dresses and behaves similarly in all the movies. But this doesn't hold up very well in the context of this particular role. First of all, there is not much to build upon, since this character doesn't provide much exposition to his backstory or his motives. He is thus not only a Man with No Name, but even more so a Man with No History. So there isn't much to build a similarity on apart from his dress-code and his behaviour throughout the movie.\nBut this behaviour isn't just shared by those three movies' heroes, but millions of others. Instead of depicting the exact same character in those movies, he actually embodies the stereotypical (and original) anti-hero of Spaghetti Westerns, from then on copied in a billion movies. And in fact many Spaghetti Western heroes share many traits with Clint Eastwood's character(s) in the Dollar Trilogy, yet they are of course entirely different characters. So rather than continuing the story of the man from A Fistful of Dollars, the filmmakers built upon this new and commercially and critically successful type of character, Leone as well as other directors of his time. (And it IMHO also fits to this kind of character and his complete lack of exposition that we don't know anything about his past and future, not even a prequel or a sequel.)\n\n\nBut I agree that this is far from definite evidence against him depicting the same character and some of my arguments might be a bit speculative, but I hope to have at least given some reasonable arguments for my point. To me, it is rather the interplay of smaller circumstantial evidence and the initial marketing as a trilogy that have lead to the theory of him being the same person in all the movies. But those individual hints IMHO don't hold strong and I think the burden of proof lies on the people claiming him to be the same character, for which a definite evidence I still haven't ever been provided with.\n\nAnd as a last little (rather tongue-in-cheek) remark, the possible lack of a definite answer is to a large degree caused by the complete lack of any kind of background information about his character and the (maybe everlasting) question if he is the same person in each movie or not might add as much to the mystery of him as all the other nonexistent history. The unanswerability of this question might thus even be seen as by-design. ;-)\n"}, {"question": "Who's the random kid standing in the gathering at the end?", "answer": "\nHarley Keener.

They both made an alliance and were able to defeat the White Walkers (the Azor Ahai legend is from this period of time). After this, they built the wall and for some time the Children of the Forest even provided the Night Watch with Dragon Glass in the case of the Walkers came back.\nFrom this, we can speculate that the magic that created the White Walkers went wrong and they turned against everyone in their way. They could be just a weapon that is out of control (I don't believe so) or they could be conscious and want revenge or even want to conquer Westeros.\nPersonally, I tend to believe that revenge would be more plausible since the way the Night King (the first Night Walker) was created.

Everyone seems to agree though, that both Lander and Ranger are very much capable of planetary lift-offs and could as well have left earth on their own. Remains the question why they chose a rocket-aided lift-off for earth. The most-compelling in-universe answers are:\n\nAs Victor also says in his answer already, they might have to carry a lot more cargo and supplies for their initial trip to the Endurance in preparation of their long journey. For this the additional boost might be required.\nThey might want to save fuel, which is made clear to be a very valuable resource. So why not rather waste a whole rocket on earth, where they could easily built and setup one and save the fuel for the, likely fuel-intensive, lift-offs for the planets where it's definitely needed.\n\nYet there is also a very good out-of-universe answer mentioned, which I'd like the most (since I appreciate analysis more than fan-fiction, but that's just me ;-)), even if it's probably to be seen in connection to the other explanations:\n\nThe usage of a classical multi-stage rocket lift-off and its whole depiction in the movie pretty much evokes reminiscences of the good old space missions, especially the Apollo missions, we experienced in the past. And this is definitely intended, since it is that pioneering attitude of space exploration that Cooper complains to have gone astray in humanity's pessimistic society of \"care-takers\". And it is this hope and inspiration humanity took from those missions that the movie wants to recall with this depiction.\n\n\nAs a little addendum, after a fruitful discussion I indeed managed to get together a computation for the escape velocity on Miller's planet in an answer to a related question over on Physics.SE (similar to jld's computation in his answer here), giving that the planet has only about 96% of earth's escape velocity. So it is indeed a little bit easier to leave it than earth (and even more likely for Mann's planet, which following the computed constraints would have to have only more than 64% of earth's density to be easier to lift off). But I still stand to the above assumption, that they could also have left earth without a rocket, hadn't they had the additional cargo, fuel constraints and obligation to show us a good old rocket launch.\n"}, {"question": "What does the missing symbol on Quaid's arm symbolize?", "answer": "\nHere is a detailed comparison between the Theatrical and Extended Director's Cut.

The first time we witness the numbers not being entered caused Oceanic 815 to crash in the first place (the plane flying over and the magnetic field becoming to strong, causing the plane to get out of control and break up and crash).\nThe second time we witness the numbers being missed is when Locke destroyed the computer, causing Desmond to activate the Fail-Safe, blowing up the Swan and the power it would try to contain in the first place.  I can only assume they chose this sequence of numbers either because of the aforementioned equation or because it was the \"serial number\" of the base.\n\n\nAs far as Hugo, because the numbers have this strange relation to the extinction of man, it could be implied that using them would cause bad luck.  However, this is never heavily implied and can be just a plot device/just a string of terrible events that happened in his life.\n\nOther than these explanations, there have been no other pure explanations for the Lost numbers by any of the creators or writers that I can find.\nOne final note to add, an answer from Damon Lindelof, explaining why the numbers don't have a definite meaning throughout the series using the Midi-chlorians from Star Wars as an example:\n\nThere are some questions that are very engaging and interesting, and then there are other questions that we have no interest whatsoever in answering. We call it the midi-chlorian debate, because at a certain point, explaining something mystical demystifies it. To try and have a character come and say, \"Here is what the numbers mean,\" actually makes every usage of the numbers up to that point less interesting.\nYou can actually watch Star Wars now, and when Obi-Wan talks about the Force to Luke for the first time, it loses its luster because the Force has been explained as, sort of, little biological agents that are in your blood stream. So you go, \"Oh, I liked Obi-Wan's version a lot better.\" Which in the case of our show is, \"The numbers are bad luck, they keep popping up in Hurley's life, they appear on the island.\" ... But if you're watching the show for a detailed explanation of what the numbers mean\u2014and I'm not saying you won't see more of them\u2014then you will be disappointed by the end of season six.\n\n"}, {"question": "What changes were made to the Star Wars Blu-ray and what effect did they have on the plot?", "answer": "\nI would like to just sum this up as the jumbled effect. Lucas basically wants as much action going on in his movies as humanly possible. Adding attention to items that we already know are there. This can be seen more vividly in Star Wars 1-3 where he adds more characters and objects to the set. \nA lot of inference is lost because of this. Instead of asking oneself why an object is on the screen just offset from center, we have the object in plain view center focus, distracting from what is important, establishing the plot and following through with that plot.\n\nEwoks blinking  \nAdding more rocks to where R2 was hiding\n\nItems like these distract the viewer from what is actually going on.\nThe most controversial change with Darth Vader, changes the emotion and environment of the scene completely.\n\nNooooooooooooo! \n\nTo who? himself? the emperor? the dark side? to his son dying?

It's a 'working' version of the script., NOT the final script that was filmed. In reading this, you'll be able to see the creative process at work. Many of the scenes were altered from the way they were originally written and others disappeared entirely. Other bits, including some of the funniest and most quoted lines from the film were written into this version of the script, and others were added in later on during filming. I've color-coded the changes so you can follow them more easily.\u00a0source: Holy Grail Working Script Part 3\n\nThat predates the theatrical release of the film (April 13, 1975) by at least a year. This version of the script has color-coded Cleese's line as BLACK: Regular text. The way the script was originally written.\n\nARTHUR: By what name are you known?\nTIM: There are some who call me Tim?\nARTHUR: Greetings Tim the Enchanter!\u00a0unabridged source: Holy Grail Working Script Part 3\n\nIf this version of the script's provenance is correct then not only is the line spoken exactly as it later appeared in the released film but the character attribution for the spoken line is Tim.\nThis evidence coupled with John Cleese's own dismissal of the rumour would seem to prove the rumour false. John Cleese has shown over the years to be a consummate professional and one of the best examples of a straight man in modern comedy. He has exhibited time and again that he can weather the most hilarious situations with a complete deadpan expression while delivering his own lines on cue and per direction. I can see how he might forget a line of dialogue irregularly but would he ever forget which character he was portraying or whose costume and makeup he was wearing?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John Cleese as Tim the Enchanter\nI think not. IMHO, John Cleese would never come on set so unprepared.\nI have no idea how the rumour got started nor how any internet rumour gets started.\nMy best guess would be Cleese's comic delivery of the line in question and the subsequent hesitation of the other party. Per the implied stage direction in the script\u00b9, he ends it with a quizzical upnote as if he was asking a question, not stating fact. The comedic effect is putting Arthur and his followers ill at ease; they don't know whether to answer in the affirmative or accept his response. Some fan-boy might have obsessed on the lilted delivery and started a rumour that Cleese was in fact asking who he was supposed to be playing.\n\n\u00b9 The ? at the end of Tim's dialog line (which is notably missing in the OP's version of the script) is the scriptwriters' way of directing the dialogue line to be delivered as a question rather than a statement.\n"}, {"question": "Significance of Cersei's obsession with elephants?", "answer": "\nIt seems they were a kind of Easter-Egg.\nIn the novels, we received a long narrative about the elephants of The Golden Company, which was left out of the show.\n\nIn George R.

Also, because of love.\nFirst and foremost, it's important to remember Vision's original statement of loyalty from Age of Ultron. He is going to side with whichever group will protect life the best.\n\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: Are you? On our side?\nVISION: It's not that simple. (pause) I'm on the side of life. Ultron is not.\n\nHe explains that he sees logic in the oversight (all following quotes from the Civil War transcript):\n\nVision: In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.\nSteve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?\nVision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.\n\nHe loves Wanda. Actor Paul Bettany confirms this in an interview with EW. Speaking of why he accidentally blasted Rhodey out of the sky, he says\n\n\u201cWhat happened there is that his judgment was clouded there by real love and affection,\u201d says Bettany. \u201cAnd he responded in a quick and thoughtless way.\u2026 I really love that the moral compass of the movie is this synthetic person who\u2019s trying to figure out what it means to be human. It\u2019s a neat idea, you know?\u201d\n\nBecause he loves Wanda, he believes that this is the best way to protect her.\n\nTony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.\nWanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.\nVision: We would protect you.\n\nHe truly believes that protecting Wanda from the public is also protecting the public.\n\nWanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?\nVision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.\nWanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.\nVision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a... more secured foundation.\nWanda Maximoff: And what do you want?\nVision: For people to see you... as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]\n\nand\n\nVision: [He faulters.] If you do this... they will never stop being afraid of you.\n\nSo, he decides to go the utilitarian route: the greatest good for the greatest number:\n\nVision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]\n\nOf course, being that he is basing his allegiance on logic, he is willing to swap sides.\nActor Paul Bettany addressed this briefly in the interview mentioned earlier.\n\n\u201cHe has logic in abundance. And logic does not afford any room for loyalty. New information could come to light and he might flip to Captain America\u2019s side. But love solidifies things and provides loyalty. So if he\u2019s there to protect mankind \u2013 or frankly, the universe \u2013 he needs to figure out what\u2019s good about these creatures, and I think that\u2019s the quest that you find him on.

In other words, he needed a thief.\nHe needed someone technical. The Ant Man suit is a highly advanced piece of machinery. He needed someone who could at least basically understand the technology behind the Ant Man suit. On top of that, the security systems at Pym Technologies is highly advanced, so he would need someone with a lot of technical ability to get through it.\nHe needed someone willing to help. This job was dangerous and, to put it lightly, unconventional. Not many people would be willing to take on the task.\nExpendable.

He was a sort of Robin Hood who burgled for good. He also took great care to make sure he did not hurt anybody during his burglaries. Check.\n\nWhile it's not shown in the movie, it's not a hard stretch to assume that Hank had a few candidates in mind. He was probably observing all of them over time. We do know that Hank was watching Scott already based off this quote (found by Johnny Bones in the comments):\n\nScott, I've been watching you for a while. Ever since you robbed Vistacorp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vistacorp. Vista's security system is one of the most advanced in the business, it's supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it.\n\nVistacorp most likely has very similar security measures as Pym Technologies. From that, it's safe to assume that Scott has gotten further than anyone before.\nHank set up the break in on his house as a sort of final job interview to see if Scott could pull it off. It was also a convenient excuse to get Scott to him so they could meet. \n"}, {"question": "Why do the machines keep humans alive if they have nuclear reactors?", "answer": "\nWell, whatever the reason machines keep humans alive, it is definitely NOT because of humans' excellence in the role of batteries. However it is possible that the machines themselves are spreading that myth. (For example Morpheus would believe anything the Oracle says). That machines don't really need humans for power is revealed in the last part, when the Architect agrees to free all humans from the Matrix.\nThe actual reasons may be much more complicated, and much more humane. The machines just don't want humans to become extinct, just like we humans are trying to protect Siberian tigers, as well as other endangered species. Even though a tiger may kill a human given the chance.\nHowever protecting humans is much harder than the tigers. You can't put them in a cage, because then their minds will degrade. You can't let them roam free, because they probably won't survive in the new world, or because they will probably keep trying to fight the machines until they kill themselves. Humans aren't very rational, you see.\nAs a solution, the tandem Matrix - Zion was created. The Matrix is conveniently situated right next to the Zion so that people in Zion can focus the majority of their energy in \"freeing\" others from the Matrix. Also, quite conveniently, the Matrix lacks any real defense mechanisms.\nIf there was just Zion without the Matrix, the humans would be trying to develop nuclear weapons or EMP bombs in order to launch the assault on the machines. Obviously they would fail, but they will also kill themselves in the attempt.\nIf there was just Matrix without Zion, then such system would run a risk of collapsing and destroying the humankind if some unforeseen catastrophe occurs. The machines aren't really good at adapting to sudden changes. And they are vulnerable to other unpredictable factors (such as Agent Smith). The machines know that, but they can't do much about it.\nNow why do they need to destroy Zion every now and then? Well, first of all they probably don't see it as much of a big deal -- the population of Zion is comparatively low. Plus they want to keep them from acquiring too dangerous technologies. Plus in most cases the goal is not really destruction, but rather the threat of destruction. For example in the last movie, several EMP charges could have destroyed the majority of attackers. The machines know that, and they probably launched the attack with the goal of failing, but making humans more scared. The machines didn't foresee however that Agent Smith would be able to interfere and stop those EMPs.\nSo in summary, it's all a well-orchestrated plan to keep humans busy, and alive.\n"}, {"question": "What is the meaning of the \u201cfly scene\u201d in Breaking Bad?", "answer": "\nAccording to a review in the Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe fly has become a symbol of the loss of control in Walt\u2019s life, so\n  its defeat is all that\u2019s important to him right now.\n\n"}, {"question": "How was Jon Snow able to kill the White Walker in S05E08?", "answer": "\nHis sword is from Valyrian steel, which also can kill White Walkers:\n\nValyrian steel is the only thing that can kill White Walkers, alongside dragonglass, although this property is not widely known, apparently, not even to the White Walkers themselves.\n\nThis has been mentioned in the books, but not in the previous episodes of the show:\n\nIn \"A Feast for Crows\", Sam Tarly tells Jon about old annals claiming\n  that dragonsteel (perhaps a synonym of Valyrian steel) is lethal to\n  the Others, like dragonglass.

It also assumes mere contact with the electric cable is required, not considering the circuit as a whole.  And finally it assumes CPR will work miracles afterwards.  None of these are correct.\n1) Electric sparks do not look at all like that, for starters.  Anyone who's jump-started a car knows what sparks look like.  The film version is pretty, but simply incorrect.\n2) Smoke is rarely a feature of electric shocks.  In order for smoke to occur, something needs to have burned.  If that had happened to Timmy, he would have a continuous burn path through his body following the path of the current.  This would be clearly visible at post-mortem.  And he would very much be \"mortem\", because this would have been a large amount of current.\nThis relates to comments on the other answer - electric fences are intended to be painful but not fatal.  The saying in the elec-eng world is \"it's the volts that jolts, but the mills (milliamps) that kills\".  If it has to be more powerful to get through dinosaur skin, the voltage can be increased substantially, but the current must not be, otherwise you'll have dead dinosaurs.  Electric fences do not appear threatening, so animals need to touch them at least once to discover that they are painful and learn to stay away from them.\n3) An electric shock will certainly cause all your muscles to spasm, which can result in a substantial jump.  I've experienced that myself.  What you do not get is the effect shown in the film, where the electric shock acts like a piston hitting Timmy in the chest.  Arms may straighten outwards, but legs straighten upwards.\n4) As everyone knows from seeing birds perched on high-voltage wires, what is required for an electric shock is a path for the electricity.  If there's no circuit, there's no current and hence no shock.  (On transmission cables, the resistance of the wire can give enough voltage at high current for a shock at human arm spacing, which is why linemen need extra protection, but these are not high-current transmission cables.)  Timmy would be in trouble when he touched the ground, but on the fence he's fine.\nUnless the people who made the fence have been sneaky and rigged each wire at a different voltage, for example using a three-phase supply with the wires alternating phases.  Touching adjacent or next-adjacent wires, as Timmy is doing, would then give you a shock too.  This has a separate problem though, which is that the foliage in contact with the fence is shown sparking, meaning it is conducting electricity.  As anyone familiar with Ohm's Law knows, this means a proportion of the current is going through the foliage instead of Timmy.  Extrapolate for the amount of foliage on this short section of fence, and you can expect Timmy to experience no shock whatsoever.\n5) If Timmy has been shocked and his heart has stopped though, CPR almost certainly won't do anything except keep his body ticking over for a bit.  That's why we have defibrillators, because hearts are very reluctant to restart on their own.  It certainly isn't the magic that films show it as.  And moreover, if Timmy's had an adult pounding on his chest, he's going to hurt.  CPR regularly breaks ribs and tears chest muscles, because essentially you're delivering a powerful sternum punch with high follow-through, over and over again.\n"}, {"question": "What is rosebud?", "answer": "\nFrom Mr. Welles himself:\n\nThe most basic of all ideas was that of a search for the true significance of the man\u2019s apparently meaningless dying words. Kane was raised without a family. He was snatched from his mother\u2019s arms in early childhood. His parents were a bank. From the point of view of the psychologist, my character had never made what is known as \u201ctransference\u201d from his mother. Hence his failure with his wives. In making this clear during the course of the picture, it was my attempt to lead the thoughts of my audience closer and closer to the solution of the enigma of his dying words. These were \u201cRosebud.\u201d The device of the picture calls for a newspaperman (who didn\u2019t know Kane) to interview people who knew him very well. None had ever heard of \u201cRosebud.\u201d Actually, as it turns out, \u201cRosebud\u201d is the trade name of a cheap little sled on which Kane was playing on the day he was taken away from his home and his mother. In his subconscious it represented the simplicity, the comfort, above all the lack of responsibility in his home, and also it stood for his mother\u2019s love which Kane never lost.\n\nsource (the rest of the article is an interesting read in itself)\n"}, {"question": "What is the significance of the sheriff's colored sunglasses in Kill Bill vol 1?", "answer": "\nIt's a direct reference to a similar image in Gone In 60 Seconds (1974)\n\nBTW: \"Eleanor\" is a customized 1971 Ford Mustang Sportsroof (redressed as 1973)\n\nSource - Wikipedia\nAs for the \"significance\" of the sunglasses, they seem just to have been an affectation of the film's creator H.

It looks like you spotted a subtle clue towards a plot twist originally planned to be revealed in season 2, that was later dropped.\n\nPycelle was originally imagined by the showrunners (possibly by author GRRM too, it's unconfirmed as far as I know) as a meek careerist toady, someone who maintains his comfortable high-status position by being useful and loyal to those with power and by avoiding letting himself be seen as a threat. \nPart of that, as they saw it at least in early seasons, was that he deliberately acted more physically feeble than he really was, in a conscious attempt to appear harmless. They filmed a (later deleted) scene, which was to be aired in season two, where Tywin calls Pycelle out on his act. \n\n\n\nAs soon as he realises he's been found out, Pycelle stands up straight, drops the stammer from his voice, and admits (rather awkwardly...) that his mannerisms were a phony ploy. It's an extreme transformation - he looks like a different man, suddenly almost as healthy and sturdy as Barristan.\nThis scene never made the cut. I don't think they explicitly state why, but given that in Season 6...\n\n ...he doesn't particularly stand up straight and fight even when being murdered to death by children. Maybe he lasts a little longer than you might expect for someone so seemingly frail, but he's quickly overwhelmed.\n\n...it's likely they re-imagined or toned down this aspect of the character before releasing the final cut of Season 2. This presumed toning down came well after the scene you refer to in Season 1, so it's likely that when season 1 was filmed, they were still imagining him in this way.\n"}, {"question": "How did Arya manage to disguise herself?", "answer": "\nContrary to KharoBangdo's reasoning, I would theorize that Arya snuck up on the Night King in one of two different ways.\nTo get some other details out of the way, looking at the scene, I do not believe her flight angle is correct to imagine that she has been hiding in a tree this whole time, waiting for the Night King to approach. Yes, the screen is slightly tilted up from Bran's perspective, but as Arya is in flight, she seems to be flying straight for the Night King - and the momentum shift slightly before they make contact (and when the Night King catches her) makes it seem much more like horizontal momentum.\nAnyway, here's really the detail that I think blows the whole 'waiting in a tree thing out of the water' -\nYou'll notice in the scene just prior to Arya revealing herself, one of the White Walkers notices something. The Walker feels a breeze, and you can see the Walker's hair get blown slightly (either by the wind or someone moving swiftly by). The Walker then looks to the right, as if the breeze came from there (or something / someone passed there).\nThis detail leads me to two theories:\n\nThat breeze was produced by Arya sneaking by. It's unclear whether or not she was making her dash straight to the Night King then or if she was making a dash through the tree line to remain relatively unseen while she approached (before making her big run up through the open ground). Perhaps some of her training from Jaqen was used here to be 'invisible' on her approach.\nA little more far fetched, but not out of the question. The Walker is Arya, who simply feels a breeze and looks to the right. Arya is borrowing the Walker's face to blend in and get close to the Night King. The breeze (and the subsequent look) are an indication that something is about to happen - or perhaps that the time is right.\n\nI think #1 is more likely, though I do hope they reveal a bit more about how this scene unfolded. Would be interesting to hear (or see) the scene from Arya's perspective.\nAt the very least, I do feel like there is some level of significance from that subtle breeze and motion the Walker makes just prior to the Night King dying. The sound of wind blowing rises up slightly over the dramatic music, and I'd like to think that was a purposeful touch.\n"}, {"question": "Are scripts seeded to identify leaks?", "answer": "\nYes\nScreenrant.com\n\nWSJ\u2019s report also contains a few interesting accounts of how recent and upcoming movies were kept under wraps. Each copy of each script for The Hunger Games adaptations has a few slightly different words, so that if it reaches the public the studio will be able to figure out exactly where the leak came from. \n\nIt's called a Canary Trap [Wikipedia Link] and it's been used for some years\n\nA canary trap is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked. Special attention is paid to the quality of the prose of the unique language, in the hopes that the suspect will repeat it verbatim in the leak, thereby identifying the version of the document.\n\nAs an example...\n\n...before drafts of the screenplay for Star Trek III: The Search for Spock were circulated, Bennett arranged for each individual copy to have subtle clues distinguishing it from the others. Shortly after Roddenberry opposed the destruction of the Enterprise at the climax of that film, fans began to complain to Paramount and Bennett.
