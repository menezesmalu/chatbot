Yes, the screen is slightly tilted up from Bran's perspective, but as Arya is in flight, she seems to be flying straight for the Night King - and the momentum shift slightly before they make contact (and when the Night King catches her) makes it seem much more like horizontal momentum.\\nAnyway, here's really the detail that I think blows the whole 'waiting in a tree thing out of the water' -\\nYou'll notice in the scene just prior to Arya revealing herself, one of the White Walkers notices something. The Walker feels a breeze, and you can see the Walker's hair get blown slightly (either by the wind or someone moving swiftly by). The Walker then looks to the right, as if the breeze came from there (or something / someone passed there).\\nThis detail leads me to two theories:\\n\\nThat breeze was produced by Arya sneaking by. It's unclear whether or not she was making her dash straight to the Night King then or if she was making a dash through the tree line to remain relatively unseen while she approached (before making her big run up through the open ground). Perhaps some of her training from Jaqen was used here to be 'invisible' on her approach.\\nA little more far fetched, but not out of the question. The Walker is Arya, who simply feels a breeze and looks to the right. Arya is borrowing the Walker's face to blend in and get close to the Night King. The breeze (and the subsequent look) are an indication that something is about to happen - or perhaps that the time is right.\\n\\nI think #1 is more likely, though I do hope they reveal a bit more about how this scene unfolded. Would be interesting to hear (or see) the scene from Arya's perspective.\\nAt the very least, I do feel like there is some level of significance from that subtle breeze and motion the Walker makes just prior to the Night King dying. The sound of wind blowing rises up slightly over the dramatic music, and I'd like to think that was a purposeful touch.\\n\"}},\n",

Things worked a bit differently\\nback then: you’d pay your nickel, take a seat, and watch a continuous\\nloop of a feature (mixed with cartoon interludes) for as long as your\\nheart desired.\\nIn 1912, Broadway producer Nils Granlund was hired as the advertising\\nmanager for a chain of East Coast movie theaters owned by entrepreneur\\nMarcus Loew. Here, Granlund produced the first-ever trailer -- a\\none-minute spot for the upcoming Broadway show, The Pleasure Seekers\\n-- which featured mainly cut up clips from the production’s rehearsals. The advertisement was shown to audiences after the feature\\nfilm, rather than before it.\\n\\nThat\\'s for a Broadway show, but movies followed:\\n\\nThat same year, in Chicago, an early film visionary by the name of\\nWilliam Selig decided to apply 19th century society’s interest in\\nprint serials (stories published in installments) to films. What\\nresulted was a 13-episode film serial called “The Adventures of\\nKathlyn.” As with print serials, it was important for Selig to end\\neach segment on a suspenseful note, so as to encourage people to come\\nsee the next one. To do this, he decided to include a brief teaser of\\n\"next week\\'s\" installment at the end of each one.\\n\\nBut when did they start appearing before the main movie?\\n\\nMost film historians contend that at some point in the late\\n1930s, theaters began showing movie trailers before the feature film\\nrather than afterward -- most likely because serial-style films were\\non their way out, and patrons often left the theater immediately\\nfollowing the film. Showing the trailers before, while the audience\\nwas obviously captive, proved more effective.\\n\\nAnd yes, people have tried renaming them:\\n\\n“[Studios] have tried calling them ‘previews,’ or ‘prevues of coming\\nattractions,’” reasoned a Paramount producer in an interview--\\nbut society has, so far, refused to accept anything other than what\\nit’s used to.\\n\\nGo read the whole article, it is fascinating.\\n'}},\n",

Online were asked a question about why movie credit were so long and as part of their answer stated:\\n\\n\"Films have always employed dozens (if not hundreds) of people in\\nvarious jobs,\" Clark University director of screen studies Tim Shary\\ntells this B!tch. \"But before the \\'60s, they tended to be in teams,\\nand usually only the leader of the unit received onscreen credit. So,\\nthe art director would be listed but not all of the people (painters,\\ndecorators, landscapers, carpenters, etc.) that worked for him or her.\\n\"Now, almost everyone who works on a film is a member of a union, and\\nthey have expectations about getting onscreen credit.\"\\nCould a director like Spielberg or a producer like Scott Rudin decide\\nto eliminate those credits during one of his 18 daily ego meltdowns?\\nNot likely, I\\'m told. During film\\'s golden age, most movie workers\\nwere under contract to a studio, so the suits could credit their\\ndrones--or not--as they saw fit. Today, people hire themselves out\\nfilm by film, giving them and their unions more power.\\n\"The presence of many credits today are adjudicated by unions and\\nguilds,\" says Penn State senior film lecturer Kevin J. Hagopian. \"So,\\nSteven Spielberg, even as a producer, could not decide simply to leave\\noff these names.\"\\n...One other factor: cheaper movies. Black-turtlenecked indie fans\\nlove to joke that the size of a small film\\'s credits is inversely\\nproportional to the size of its budget. (What, you expected these\\npeople to have a real sense of humor?) Instead of paying cash,\\nindie-film producers often offer key spaces in their credits as a\\nthank-you.\\n\"When freelancing replaced the studio contract system, studios and\\nproducers realized they could pay people less if they gave them\\ncredit,\" San Francisco State University film professor Joseph McBride\\nsays. \"So, the proliferation of credits went bananas in the \\'70s and\\n\\'80s, to the point that now even the honey-wagon driver is credited.\"\\n\\nSo there does appear to be legalities involved in having people gain credits. Some examples of this can be seen for particular \"groups\":\\n\\nWriter\\'s Guild\\nProducer\\'s Guild\\n\\nAcknowledgement used as a form of intellectual property\\nQuoting directly from Wikipedia, which rather nicely sums it up:\\n\\nIn the creative arts and scientific literature, an acknowledgment\\n(also spelled acknowledgement) is an expression of gratitude for\\nassistance in creating an original work.\\nReceiving credit by way of\\nacknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or\\norganization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in\\nquestion, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or\\nencouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying\\nacknowledgments; Cronin et al.give the following six categories:\\na) moral support\\nb) financial support\\nc) editorial support\\nd) presentational\\nsupport\\ne) instrumental/technical support\\nf) conceptual support, or peer\\ninteractive communication (PIC)\\nApart from citation, which is not\\nusually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of\\nconceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for\\nidentifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgments of financial\\nsupport, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by\\nthe granting institution.\\n\\nSo it appears many people, from actors through to cameramen, can use the fact they are included in credits as a form of \"proof\" on their CV so to speak, to absolutely guarantee they were involved in a project in that particular role.\\nAn example of this on a minor stage, is the IMDB Credit System, which explicitly states that anyone can add their name as an actor to a film, but their system will check it against the official \"credits\" and remove it if not featured.\\nPublic interest\\nWhilst I imagine the majority of film watchers do not watch the end credits, there are a some who do (call them Dawsons) and are genuinely interested in how a particular part of a film was achieved (e.g. how a sound effect was completed or who was in charge of animal safety, etc).\\nEdit:\\nTo add in some of the fantastic points made in the comments:\\nTom: People want acknowledgement for their hard work with a place in the credits, regardless of whether the audience will watch it.\\nDamon: The credits add to the length of the movie which increases the amount of money it can be licensed to broadcasters for.\\nClaudio Miklos: The credits are a piece of film history, recording for all time exactly who did what with a film.\\n'}},\n",

Although they agreed with my first point, they also had this fascinating theory:\\n\\nMight the death of Walt Disney\\'s mother  -  and the lifelong guilt\\nthis left her son with  -  be the catalyst for the death of parents in\\nDisney?\\nIn 1938 and riding high with the proceeds from his first big\\nscreen movie Sleeping Beauty, Walt bought his mother, Flora, and his\\nfather, Elias, a house in LA as a golden wedding anniversary present.\\nWithin days of moving in, Flora complained about the stultifying\\ntemperatures coming from the central heating boiler and her doting son\\narranged for a swift replacement.\\nDays later, Flora died from\\nasphyxiation caused by the new, poorly-installed, boiler.\\nMight Walt\\nDisney\\'s misplaced guilt over his mother\\'s death have led him to\\nairbrush parents  -  mothers in particular  -  out of his works?\\nAnd\\nhas that motivation, after his death in 1966, become a Disney\\nblueprint?\\nCertainly, it would explain the types of folk stories and\\nfairytales that Disney has acquired for adaptation, even when there\\nare numerous other traditional tales that feature a mother and father.\\n\\nFinally, it\\'s also worth noting that not all movies have dead parents. This list shows the following Disney films as having both parents alive at the end of the film:\\n\\nLady and the Tramp\\nSleeping Beauty\\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians\\nMulan\\nThe Incredibles\\nPeter Pan\\nBrave\\nLion King 2\\nTangled (although parent-like villain dies)\\nHercules\\n\\nEdit:\\nI whipped this answer up fairly quickly and really should have expanded on a few points. As many comments under the post have indicated, this \"style\" is a common trope. As TV Tropes express (rather tongue-in-cheek):\\n\\nParents Are Useless. They leave you and abuse you. Good Parents are\\nhard to come by. It appears that the only decent parents are the dead\\nones.\\nThese are the parents that leave the characters behind, not by\\nchoice, early on in the story, sometimes even before the story begins.\\nThe characters are now all alone with no family. They may find a\\nParental Substitute, but they may not always be the best guardians.\\nThese often heroic characters will always have fond memories of their\\nparents. That\\'s because these parents did everything right while they\\nwere alive. They spent time with their children and taught them\\ninvaluable life lessons that they continue to keep even to this day.\\nEven though the parents are gone now, the actions of the parents still\\naffect the character and keep him going.\\n\\nFinally, it does make logical sense (from an animation point of view) for parents to die as it would most definitely cut down on production costs - although the life lessons learned from their deaths are obviously the main focus.\\n'}},\n",

The elevator was damaged due to a malfunctioning experiment of Leonard's (He wrongly calculated the mixture for the experimental rocket Fuel he was developing), which Sheldon recognized as going critical so he placed it in the elevator. It exploded inside and took out the entire elevator cab. (The Staircase Implementation, Season 3, Episode 22)\\nThe cost of a new elevator cab (and maybe the motor/hydraulic system and everything else) and structural repairs to the elevator shaft for a ~8 story building like that would be in the low to mid 6 digits. And would be a labor intensive multi-month project. From a New York Times Article on modernizing an Existing, working elevator system:\\n\\nIn a six-story building, a standard elevator modernization (frequently involving replacement of the cab rather than remodeling it) costs about $100,000, including consultant fees, said Joseph Caracappa, an elevator consultant ... A project in a 6- to 12-story building generally costs around $125,000, while anything taller will require roughly $150,000 to $175,000. [He] on my building’s project, said that these figures assume that some components won’t need changing. Our 89-year-old drum-hoisted elevator, being well past its sell-by date, needed everything, which is why our job cost substantially more. Also, we spent about $20,000 on the interior finishes, on the higher side of a range from $7,500 to $30,000.\\n\\nThat's putting a regular fix at < $200,000. An explosion would likely add much more cost to it. \\nBetween the High Cost, the amount of work required, and not having anyone to blame/sue/recover the cost from, it's understandable why the elevator has not been fixed.\\n\"}},\n",

After the commercial success of the original Star Wars, Lucas was able to continue with the multi-film epic he originally envisioned. The first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, was released in 1980 and bore the full title of \"Star Wars, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back\" in the title crawl, although it was referred to only as \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the title of its commercial release. It was the \"Episode V\" appearing in the opening crawl which originally confused those members of the audience who had not been made aware of what Lucas was explaining, that the original Star Wars was now to be understood to be the fourth part of a nine-part series. The original Star Wars was re-released in 1981 with a new title \"Star Wars, Episode IV, A New Hope\" in the title crawl. This title appeared on all subsequent re-releases and versions from then on (though the original version was released on DVD in 2006, which shows the title crawl in its original form). All subsequent Star Wars films have followed this new naming structure, although \"Star Wars\" often refers specifically to the 1977 film.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'}},\n",

(Discussed here)\\nThe script wasn't completed when the endings were shot:\\nin this case the details of the script are still being worked on, so the crew shoots multiple endings with the hope that one will eventually be used as the final, official ending.\\nThe original ending was seen as too graphic or violent especially studio is trying to hit a specific rating (usually PG-13 instead of R), so the ending will be slightly edited:\\nAn example of this was Thelma and Louise (1991) (discussed here).\\n\\nOnly a tiny tweak here, but a fairly significant one — the first ending showed Thelma and Louise's car tumbling all the way to the canyon floor, no doubt getting pulverized in the process. Harvey Keitel's character finds the Polaroid that blew out of the car and looks at it as a helicopter heads down into the Grand Canyon to survey the wreckage. As you probably know, the updated ending is a wee bit more hopeful — we see their car drive off the cliff, but not the aftermath.\\n\\nThe studio or the director specifically wants multiple endings: the only example I can think of for this is Clue (1985) where the movie was shot with three different endings, each one would be randomly selected during each showing.

       "     'answer': '\\nThe reuse of animation in this way is attributed to director/producer Wolfgang Reitherman, and was reportedly done because the animation had already proved to work well in its previous use.\\nFrom The Real Truth About Disney’s “Recycled Animation” (Medium crosspost), as reported by Jim MacQuarrie regarding an interview with Floyd Norman (emphasis mine):\\n\\nHe nodded, laughed and said, “That was Woolie Reitherman.” A quick check of Wolfgang Reitherman’s IMDB page confirms that nearly every Disney film shown using recycled footage in these videos is one he directed, most notably the Jungle Book, Robin Hood, the Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh, 101 Dalmatians and the AristoCats.\\n“It’s actually harder and takes longer to redraw an existing sequence,” Norman told me, “it’s a lot faster and easier to just do new animation, and it’s a lot more fun for the animators. But Woolie liked to play it safe and use stuff he knew would work. That’s all it was.”\\n\\nMilt Kahl, another of Disney\\'s \"Nine Old Men\" among Norman and Reitherman, confirms in a 1976 interview with Michael Barrier and Milton Gray:\\n\\nBarrier: I can\\'t see how the re-use of animation saves money.\\nKahl: It doesn\\'t. The funny thing is that most of the time they spend more money trying to figure out how to re-use it than they would [animating the scene from scratch]. I\\'d rather see it animated from scratch; even if it\\'s a little bit amateurish, at least it\\'s fresh and new.\\n\\nThis primary-source reporting was then cited in the Wikipedia article on Wolfgang Reitherman, as notes 15 and 18 respectively:\\n\\nDuring his tenure, he [Wolfgang Reitherman] frequently used \"recycled\" or limited animation from prior works, presumably because it was a safer method for a quality product, though it was in fact more labor-intensive15, not because it was supposedly cheaper.16,17 Reitherman\\'s use of recycling animation proved to be controversial within the studio as animator Milt Kahl lamented its use stating \"I detest the use of—it just breaks my heart to see animation from Snow White used in The Rescuers. It kills me, and it just embarrasses me to tears.\"18\\n\\nAdmittedly, it is possible that the motivation was saving money or streamlining the production, and that the animators took a cynical or futile view, but in any case the practice is associated specifically with Reitherman and fellow animators felt it was less about money than about using what had worked in previous films.\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth, MacQuarrie\\'s update cites different reasons for Beauty and the Beast, in a conversation with Gary Trousdale that still cites Reitherman\\'s precedent:\\n\\n“The scene from Beauty and the Beast that we re-used was done for time, but not money. (well…time IS money, but that’s another story). We were just days from our final deadline to deliver, and we had an entire dance sequence (the last scene of the movie, not the ballroom) to do. Everyone was booked and busy, and we knew damn well that Woolie had established this precedent, so we took the Sleeping Beauty dance, re-sized and re-positioned it, and gave the note ‘Note to Clean-up: clean up Aurora as Belle, clean up Prince Charming as Beast.’”\\n\\n'}},\n",

       "     'answer': \"\\nDavid Prowse definitely did not have the right voice. He is from Bristol in the UK, and has a Bristolian accent, what would be described as in the UK as a 'west country accent'. To many ears this sounds a little parochial - most people would think this more the accent for a farmer than a galactic enforcer for the Emperor, however unfair that comparison might be.  However David Prowse was a body-builder, had acting experience so he had the right look at 6 foot 6 inches tall.  He was also from the UK where many of the scenes involving Vader were made.\\nJames Earl Jones is to a degree the opposite - he has an amazing voice, and although a more accomplished actor than Prowse, does not have the right bodybuilder physical presence and is (only) 6 foot 2 inches tall.\\nFinally, why Sebastian Shaw and not Prowse for the final scene with Vader? They may have thought that Prowse, only in his late 40's, might look a little too young to be Luke's father, and the accent would have been too striking a difference to the 'in helmet' voice.  Of course with the later casting of Hayden Christensen as the young Anakin, the age would have been about right.\\n\"}},\n",

Because at this moment, she realised that she could have easily take Kings Landing, two seasons ago. \\nShe realized she could have dealt with the Night King threat after becoming Queen.\\nShe lost two dragons, Jorah, Missandei, and a big part of her army, while a simple attack with only one dragon was enough.\\nShe realized all those previous sacrifices were useless.\\nHow can she be such a good ruler in Essos, but so cruel in Westeros?\\nWhile it seems odd that the same character rule in a quite different way between two realms, this is not unrealistic. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, political scientist and game theorist, studied the reign of Leopold II, King of Belgium and Congo. The exact same person rules these two kingdoms in very different ways, but there is a reason for this: the power was not held by the same people/structure. Two different kingdoms, two different ways to conquer/keep the power. \\n\\nAbstract \\n  From 1885 until 1908 Leopold II was not only the King of Belgium but also the personal owner of the Congo Free State. The policy outcomes during his reign turned out to be fundamentally different in the two countries: Whereas in Belgium he improved living conditions, in the Congo he established a brutal tyranny. This paper analyses the reasons for these different leadership styles of Leopold II by means of the \\'selectorate theory\\'. The selectorate theory explains policy outcomes as a function of governance institutions. It assumes that the ruler maximizes his own utility which means first of all to sustain himself in power. Under Belgium\\'s governmental institutions Leopold II required broad support from the general public but in the Congo he only needed a very small group of supporters. To reduce the possibility that Leopold\\'s different leadership styles were caused mainly by racism his period is compared to the reign of the Congolese leader Mobutu Sese Seko. \\nLeopold II and the Selectorate: An Account in Contrast to a Racial Explanation, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita\\n\\nThe same thing can be said for Essos and Westeros. In Essos, she is seen as a liberator and can earn the love of her people, whereas she is seen as a conqueror in Westeros, and must rule with fear\\n'}},\n",

       "     'answer': \"\\nPetyr Baelish wants one thing: power. He is the son of a very minor lord with very poor holdings. He grew up seeing the love of his life get married to someone else with a more powerful family name. He knows that he can never actually rule in name, but he wants to be at least the real power behind the throne. For that to happen he needs to setup a puppet king that he can control. \\nSo Lord Baelish's plan was to back Joffrey's claim to the throne and isolate him from his mother (and the Lannisters) with Lord Stark serving as Joffrey's regent since he is under-aged. In return for this he expected to become Lord Stark's right hand man, giving him a great amount of power especially given Stark's limited political skills.\\nBut Lord Stark had other ideas. He wanted to expose Joffrey's parentage and install Stannis Baratheon and the new king of Westeros. Lord Baelish knew Stannis very well from serving with him in the Small Council. Stannis is a humorless man who had no patience for his scheming and was someone he could not easily manipulate, thus costing him a great amount of power and influence. This was, to him, unacceptable.\\nSo Lord Baelish sided with the Lannisters and helped them foil Stark's plan. Now he has the trust of the Lannisters with all the influence that gives him. The Lannisters are nothing if not generous to those loyal to them, and through further services to the Lannisters he is awarded with the lordship of Harrenhal.\\n\"}},\n",

       "     'answer': \"\\nYou do have a point in that the fuel could have been syphoned. However, it's more likely that there just wasn't any. When the doc gets back to 1885 with broken time circuits, he first tries to fix it. When he realizes it can't be fixed, he buries the car in the mine after first draining it of all fluids.\\nWhile it is unclear if the car could be dug up, it wouldn't have had any fuel. The doc would have had to keep all fluids that he drained from the car. You could argue that some gasoline could always come in handy, but as the doc mentions in his letter, he is concerned about the space time continuum. Keeping it around in his shop would be dangerous (what if someone found it?) and he wasn't going to use it in a car as he specifically forbids Marty to rescue him. To avoid disrupting space-time, the simplest thing would have been to dispose of all fuel.\\nThe official explanation can be found here. Apparently the time paradox for going back into the mine was too dangerous too go back in. However, Doc could have still drained it and kept it in his shop. Either he didn't want to keep it around (for the danger of discovery) or he didn't see the point in keeping it.\\n\"}},\n",

He needed someone who could at least basically understand the technology behind the Ant Man suit. On top of that, the security systems at Pym Technologies is highly advanced, so he would need someone with a lot of technical ability to get through it.\\nHe needed someone willing to help. This job was dangerous and, to put it lightly, unconventional. Not many people would be willing to take on the task.\\nExpendable.

Oh, excuse me, burgled Vistacorp. Vista's security system is one of the most advanced in the business, it's supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it.\\n\\nVistacorp most likely has very similar security measures as Pym Technologies. From that, it's safe to assume that Scott has gotten further than anyone before.\\nHank set up the break in on his house as a sort of final job interview to see if Scott could pull it off.

       "     'answer': '\\nFirst of all, the possession of the ring didn\\'t stay entirely without effect even to Bilbo. Remember how everyone was surprised at Bilbo\\'s apparently unaged looks compared to his actual age (and his pretty fast aging once he didn\\'t have the ring anymore). And also remember his reluctance to give up the ring (into which he had to be seriously \"persuaded\" by Gandalf) and his \"outburst\" in Rivendell when he caught a glimpse of it on Frodo\\'s neck (a scene that made me jump in my seat on the first view and that still terrifies me whenever I see it). Those effects might very well have worsened if Bilbo would have kept the ring for longer.\\n\\nBut another important aspect is, that Gollum is a morally weaker person to begin with. After all the ring for him was won in an act of evil in the first place, murdering his friend for the \"precious\". That is something we could surmise Bilbo wouldn\\'t have done, as evident from the mercy he showed Gollum -- a supposedly disgusting creature he didn\\'t even know -- when he had him at the point of his sword after stealing his ring. But he saw what a miserable creature Gollum was and felt compassion for him.\\nThen add to this, that Gollum is also pretty much a product of his circumstances. When he killed his friend he became a social outcast, which even more contributed to his further moral degradation and his alienation from \"normal\" social life. His split personality might on the one hand be just a natural result of his loneliness but might on the other hand as well be a way to cope with his deeds, first and foremost the murder of his friend, either by said friend manifesting as the second personality or just as an attempt to blame his deeds on that \"other person\" living inside of him. And the fact that he became a cave-dweller far from the sunlight eating raw fish and orcs and whatever vile creatures might have contributed to his further physical deterioration. Bilbo on the other hand still lived a happy life as an accepted member of a blooming social environment so that the ring couldn\\'t unfold its whole potential on him, but after all we also know that if the ring has anything, it\\'s patience.\\n'}},\n",

       "     'answer': \"\\nI love the question.\\nHere's a summary from a very tight explanation (with some drawings):\\nInception and Kicks\\nThere were two types of dreams. The simple construct with a mild sedative and the more complex construct with a strong sedative.\\nIn the simple construct, one kick is enough. Kick can be either to the self (eg: Arthur shot in the head) or a kick from above (eg: Cobb dunked in bath tub). The sedative is light so there is no synchronization required. In real life this can be equated to sleeping and dreaming about falling, the fall in the dream wakes us up. Alternately someone wakes you up by pushing you off the bed.\\nIn a strong sedative, complex construct dream - a single kick is not going to be enough. A person needs two synchronized at the same instant. One kick to the self and one from the level above. The synchronization is done using music. In the real world, this can be equated to being under total anesthesia. Neither would a bad dream fall wake you up nor would pushing you off the operating table. The reel part here is that if some how pushing you off the table can be coincided with the fall in your dream, you can wake up.\\nNow, in the act of inception on Fischer's mind, they are in a complex heavily sedated dream. The only viable kick here is falling because death will take you to limbo. As mentioned in another answer, waiting it out is not going to work because weeks and months would need to pass in the lower layers. Waiting it out is a possible option only in the first layer because there is limited time dilation. Also a single kick from a level above or jumping off a cliff in the current level wont work as a kick. The dreamer is far too sedated for that. A person needs to fall in the current level and the level above simultaneously so so they plan. The following kicks (falls) are planned:\\nLevel 1 : Van Falling\\nLevel 2 : Falling by one floor (blowing up the floor)\\nLevel 3 (inception level) : Falling from the building (blowing up the structure)\\nOf course, things don't go as plan. Hence they improvise on the kicks.\\nHere is the set of synchronized kicks that each one receives per level of dream.\\nPoint to note, no two people receive the same two kick pairs.\\nHere's the image from the link:\\n\\n(source: thisisbarry.com)\\nSo, other than dying in limbo, everything else needs a pair of synchronized kicks.

Obviously this is due to the medium, movies and comics are verbal and the film makers need you to relate to human (ish) characters in a short amount of time. Sticking to radio silence and code names would make them too stiff to like.\\nThat said, only Cap, Wilson and maybe Barton fail in this respect.  They are the only traditional soldier types and would have radio discipline drilled into them. Then again. It's only really Wilson, as the rank and file soldier. Rogers spent most of his military career as a mascot capsicle, and the other half ignoring orders as a special agent. Nat is a spy, Thor is a loud boasting rage drunk, Lang a thief, Stark an egomaniac, etc.\\nNotice that SHIELD agents do not have the same lack of discipline or screen time that would cinematically necessitate this informal kidding over comms.\\nBut to expand, there is more to it. The Avengers have the typical comic banter type of group dynamics. Contrast Cap in the serious missions during The First Avenger. Quick action scenes, and then his solo mission at the end. Widow uses talking as a weapon, to distract and throw off guard both foe and friend. It's part of her whole M.O., unassuming power house.

       "    '_source': {'question': 'Why do old movies sound like old movies?',\n",
       "     'answer': '\\nOne of the biggest differences between older films and more modern ones is the changing nature of acting over the years.\\nThe further back you go in the history of film, the more you\\'ll find movie acting merging with stage acting: Big movements, bombastic delivery, exaggerated facial expressions.\\nAs acting on film began adapting to the medium (the ability to have close-ups, etc), the medium itself adapting and developing (camera work becoming more agile; initially cameras stayed further back and were often stationary, really doing nothing more than framing films like stage plays) and with the introduction of things like The Method, people were able to develop a much more subtle, intimate and nuanced acting style. One of my favourite films is the Coens\\' The Man Who Wasn\\'t There (2001). Not only does the camera spend much of the movie trained on Billy Bob Thornton\\'s face - so much of his work in that film involves subtle, almost imperceptible changes in facial expressions and eye movements - it\\'s really a good example of something that couldn\\'t and wouldn\\'t have been done that way many decades ago.\\nI recently watched an old Hitchcock film starring a young Paul Newman (Torn Curtain, 1966). He stood out from other cast members on that movie as he was already developing a much more \"modern\" acting style. It was a good exercise in the contrast.\\nRegarding sound effects: early on, American and British film and TV were very similar, but America soon started using a much more developed system of foley which the British didn\\'t bother with for some time. Even today, American film and TV have a much more complete foley approach (having created the role of foley artist, based in the work of Jack Foley).  Extensive foley work gives a much greater control over the sound of final product, just as post production effects give control over the image.\\nAlong the way, you notice the refining of the foley presence and process (just as you do with post-production effects); it\\'s much more heavy-handed before it settled down into a streamlined and nuanced process. You can read about the origins of foley here, and the more general history of its development here.\\nAs for speech in film, you\\'ll notice changes over time: there is the speed of their speech. In early periods of film, the cultural perception was that rapid delivery evinced certainty and confidence, and as an extra bonus, a lot of speech covered up lacks in sound effects or the presence of too much background noise (dialogue was harder to isolate with older technology). \\nAnd as others have said, the accent often used in earlier American films is the Mid-Atlantic or Trans-Atlantic accent, which was \"a consciously learned blend of American English and British English, intended to favor neither.\" While this attempt to use an accent acceptable to either the British or American ear has fallen by the wayside in favour of the actual American vernacular, the tendency still exists in a small way, like when Canadians adjust their accent to sound neither specifically Canadian nor American, or when actors from my part of the world adjust how they speak to sound neither distinctly like an Australian or a New Zealander, for example.\\n'}},\n",

The downside is that some people might find the laugh track offensive and not watch out of spite. Clearly different producers have different expectations of which effect will predominate, which leads to different choices; the production cost of adding laugh tracks is rather small, and probably not decisive.\\n\"}},\n",

Well, as you will read below, this isn\\'t actually specified like this, but since the source speaks of the \"brain becoming a  wireless connection\", it seems the safest thing to assume.\\nIn any case, no magic is involved.\\nIn the IMDB FAQ page for Matrix Revolutions, we see the question: What explanation does the movie give for Neo now having his powers in the real world?\\nAnd the answer is (emphasis mine).\\n\\nThe machines in the real world are all connected to a \"singular consciousness\", the birth of Artificial Intelligence described by Morpheus in the first Matrix film. This consciousness is otherwise known as \"The Source\". The machine connection is a remote one or some sort of wireless signal. Having touched The Source (i.e. meeting with the Architect) and having the data needed to reboot the Matrix, Neo is, at this point, simultaneously in possession of his human brain but also connected to the singular consciousness. In other words, his is also now a wireless connection. Hence the reason Neo says, \"Something\\'s different. I can feel them.\" The machines are all separate entities but all connected to this one Source.\\nNow, Neo is connected as well. He is thereby able to harness this power and stop the Sentinels. However, Neo wasn\\'t ready to handle the signal surge at the end of Reloaded and collapsed in a comatose state, no longer in control of just where this wireless signal would be directed. The signal (Neo\\'s residual self-image) is then captured and held in a program limbo derived from the Source but undetected as an existing realm, so to speak.\\nThis limbo (the \"Mobil Ave\" train station) was created by the Trainman (Bruce Spence), a program in service to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). This connection forged by Neo\\'s visit to the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis) and his subsequent decision to return to the real world made him, unknowingly, unique. Neo became simultaneously human and machine in a sense.\\n\\n'}},\n",

You got the gift, but it looks like you\\'re waiting for something.\\nNeo: What?\\nOracle: Your next life, maybe. Who knows? That\\'s the way these things go.\\n\\nThe sorry is a little ambiguous, and could easily be taken to mean \"Sorry, you\\'re wrong on that\". However, the last part of the conversation is the important part.\\nWhen Neo gets \"killed\" in the Matrix, his body is still around, and consciousness presumably hasn\\'t departed yet. Trinity confesses that she was destined to fall in love with the One, and she loves Neo, so he couldn\\'t be dead.\\nThis resonates with the consciousness that is still there, and he cognitively realizes and dissociates himself with the concept of death being tied to the Matrix, and is \"reborn\" in the Matrix. This fulfills all parts of the prophecy, Neo is on his \"next life\", Trinity is in love with him, and Matrix go boom.\\n'}},\n",

More frequently, a specific type of character (Russian, for instance) is played over and over again by the same, small, group of actors well known in the entertainment community. The same Russians get the same Russian parts. The same Italians get the same Italian parts.\\nIf the part is too small to bother, or the actor sought is not available, studios don’t bother trying to develop new talent for a one shot deal. They would rather go with someone who can get close to acting the part. And, they will count on the audience suspending their belief for the sake of the storyline. The belief being that it is better entertainment to have good acting than realistic portrayal. Especially when the portrayal of the character must be exaggerated for the audience to get what would normally be subtleties.\\nCase in point, I like action movies. Combat movies are shot predominantly with actors who have never been trained in combat. Instead, they go through a crash course on combat techniques. Then, their scenes are choreographed for the maximum visual effect. The audience impact is valued over the actual realism. Even if it means that certain effective combat techniques are replaced with those that would go against actual training, be ill-advised, or be down-right disastrous  in actual combat. When actual combat veterans are cast in speaking roles, the realism of combat scenes increases. But, the acting and dialogue quality suffers. It is not in the combat veterans’ skill set. Can it be taught/learned? Yes, at the expense of time. But, it is much easier to teach an actor how to act like the character at the expense of realism.\\n'}},\n",

Ultron is not.\\n\\nHe explains that he sees logic in the oversight (all following quotes from the Civil War transcript):\\n\\nVision: In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.\\nSteve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?\\nVision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.\\n\\nHe loves Wanda. Actor Paul Bettany confirms this in an interview with EW. Speaking of why he accidentally blasted Rhodey out of the sky, he says\\n\\n“What happened there is that his judgment was clouded there by real love and affection,” says Bettany. “And he responded in a quick and thoughtless way.… I really love that the moral compass of the movie is this synthetic person who’s trying to figure out what it means to be human. It’s a neat idea, you know?”\\n\\nBecause he loves Wanda, he believes that this is the best way to protect her.\\n\\nTony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.\\nWanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.\\nVision: We would protect you.\\n\\nHe truly believes that protecting Wanda from the public is also protecting the public.\\n\\nWanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?\\nVision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.\\nWanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.\\nVision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a... more secured foundation.\\nWanda Maximoff: And what do you want?\\nVision: For people to see you... as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]\\n\\nand\\n\\nVision: [He faulters.] If you do this... they will never stop being afraid of you.\\n\\nSo, he decides to go the utilitarian route: the greatest good for the greatest number:\\n\\nVision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]\\n\\nOf course, being that he is basing his allegiance on logic, he is willing to swap sides.\\nActor Paul Bettany addressed this briefly in the interview mentioned earlier.\\n\\n“He has logic in abundance. And logic does not afford any room for loyalty. New information could come to light and he might flip to Captain America’s side. But love solidifies things and provides loyalty. So if he’s there to protect mankind – or frankly, the universe – he needs to figure out what’s good about these creatures, and I think that’s the quest that you find him on. And, of course, in the comics, the relationship becomes romantic. We’ll see moving forward what happens for Vision and Wanda.”\\n\\n\"}},\n",

Obviously, having more different nations in a more compressed space gives a lot more chances for interactions.\\nIf we take a U.S. spy, Jason Bourne, and send him on a mission, we must, by definition, deploy him to take actions against foreign agents and foreign governments.  The genre can be described as \"international espionage,\" so we need OTHER countries.... so, Europe.  Middle East is also popular.\\nHowever, I do think this is your own Euro-centric viewpoint. A huge portion of the Jason Bourne films splits time between him tracking down his past in Europe, but also coming back to the USA, to infiltrate the CIA and its training facilities.\\nHere are some spy or international terrorism-based movie themes that pit US intelligence services against \"bad guys\" that are almost entirely based in the USA (most of these are actually pretty good, too):\\n\\nThe Falcon and the Snowman (based on a true story)\\nThree Days of the Condor\\nThe Devil\\'s Own\\nBlown Away\\nThe Siege\\nBreach (true story)\\nEnemy of the State\\nNighthawk\\nMercury Rising\\nThe Conversation\\nThe Osterman Weekend\\nThe Parallax View\\nSneakers\\nNo Way Out\\nClear and Present Danger\\nSum of All Fears\\n\\n(I\\'m not sure about the ratio of USA domestic to foreign in those last two, but I think they\\'re set mostly in the USA)\\nMany movies in the US backdrop focus more on law enforcement and FBI because our spy agencies are prohibited by law from performing espionage against domestic targets, so you get more of a law enforcement angle, like in the movie Betrayed about an FBI agent infiltrating a domestic terrorist organization.\\n'}},\n",

       "     'answer': \"\\nYou've pointed at a good flaw. Drogon would have been an equally valid target.\\nBut there are some options here as to why the NK chose Viserion over Drogon.\\n1. Drogon is considerably larger.\\nAlthough the ice spear did penetrate Viserion's skin with relative ease, Drogon is a considerably larger and stronger dragon. \\nWe don't know much about the ice spear and whether it has any magical qualities that help with killing dragons. But given that Qyburn's ballista would make for an effective weapon too, I'm going to assume that dragon scales can be penetrated by brute force alone, without any magic. The ice spear was thrown with a tremendous amount of force.\\nBut maybe killing Drogon was a stretch. He's a bigger dragon, and looks to be more armored as well. Maybe the Night King wasn't sure that it'd kill Drogon, and therefore he focused on the smaller, weaker dragons first.\\n2. Drogon was on the ground.\\nViserion was hit, couldn't fly anymore, and hit the ice with a considerable impact. When Dany flies away later, you can see that the mark Viserion left on the ice is by far the largest, thus showing that Viserion made a high velocity, high impact landing.\\nDrogon was on the ground. Even if he were to be hit in the same fashion as Viserion, he wouldn't hit the ground with such an impact, thus not knocking him out or killing him on impact. This may give Drogon (or Danaerys) the time to deal with the spear.\\nViserion did lose a lot of blood very quickly; but Drogon is comparatively larger and more armored, would bleed less, and is maybe able to shrug it off more easily (similar to why stabbing a dog-sized animal with a dagger will kill it, but stabbing an elephant-sized animal will only wound it)\\nThere is another thing to consider here. The spear hit Viserion under the wing. I'm not sure how much of a marksman the Night King is, but he hit Viserion in a place that would prevent him from flying, which is exactly how he should have taken Viserion down. It's also likely that the dragons are less armored near their wings, because armoring would chafe them during flying. They need a fair range of movement with their wings.  \\nThis is pure speculation, but if we assume that the Night King was aiming for a weak spot near the base of the wing, Drogon would not be a viable target as he was using his wings to rest on the ground, and therefore covering it. The weak spot would not be visible/hittable by the Night King.\\nEven if he could pierce Drogon's wing to hit the weak spot anyway, he had no line of sight to the weak spot and would be guesstimating his throw. Since this theory assumes that the Night King was aiming precisely, that makes Drogon a difficult target to accurately hit (exactly on the weak spot).  \\nComparatively, the flying dragons were better targets, as their weak spots are more exposed to those below them.\\nLooking at the linked image in GhotiandChips' answer, from the Night King's perspective, most of what he could hit on Drogon seems to either be pretty well armored, or invisible due to the wing covering line of sight to it.\\n3. Drogon couldn't escape right away.\\nIt should have been clear to the Night King that Drogon was the transport dragon, carrying Dany and soon also the others. This slows Drogon down. He is also not able to just up and leave, because he can't leave Dany or the others, who will be quickly overwhelmed by the wights.\\nThe Night King wasn't trying to kill one dragon, he was trying to kill multiple dragons. He obviously did not stop at killing one. Though we didn't see him throw a third spear, nor target Rhaegal specifically, it seems fair to assume that he was trying to kill all the dragons.\\nIf he kills Drogon first, Rhaegal and Viserion can immediately fly away. They are already in the air, mobile, and they don't have to take people along with them.\\nIf he kills a flying dragon first, Drogon can't just fly away. Not only will it take him more time to leave (due to not flying already), he also needs to load people, and presumably fly more safely so that the people do not fall off (evidenced by Jorah almost falling off when Drogon dodged the spear).\\nIf you're trying to kill as much as you can, start by killing those who can run away to safety quickly, and kill the slow ones later.\\n4. Unknown and out of universe reasons\\n\\nViserion was the weakest dragon, mentally and physically. Maybe that's why Viserion was targeted. Maybe dragons can resist the resurrection of the white walkers (or retain their identity), but Viserion is notably weak (as was Vyserys, who the dragon is named after). But this is pure speculation of course.\\nIt's a story. It wouldn't make narrative sense to kill the representative dragon first. Drogon is shown considerably more often than the others, because he is the representative of the dragons. This is similar to Thormund. We haven't seen any wildlings (excuse me, Free Folk) lately. Whenever the wildl... Free Folk have been part of the story, they have been represented by Thormund. Other representatives are Grey Worm (for the Unsullied), Daario (for the Second Sons), Yohn Royce (for the knights of the Vale), Jaqen (for the Faceless Men, who really should be represented by many faces to prove a point), ...\\nIt's classic exposition. When a villain introduces his doomsday weapon, he will usually showcase its ability on a random test subject. This is done to prove to the viewer that the weapon is real and deadly. I could point to another example from Rick and Morty. There is a scene where Rick is sad, but is not speaking (it's just music playing). He takes out a device, and a little creature, and kills the creature with the device. He then puts the device on his own head, clearly intending to kill himself. If the viewer did not see the first creature die, they would not understand that this is a suicide attempt (e.g. maybe it's a device to clear headaches). The same is true here. Viserion's death proves to the viewer that dragons can be killed by White Walkers. Up until now, that was never proven. It's possible that viewers thought that the dragons are the be all end all solution to White Walkers, but this scene proves that they are still risking their lives by fighting the White Walkers.\\n\\n\"}},\n",

The character wasn’t revived for the later films.\\nI found a few interviews that touch on the topic of Peeves.\\nFirst, there was an interview with BBC Norfolk with Chris Rankin, who played Percy Weasley, where he explains that they actually shot scenes with Peeves, but they were cut from the film:\\n\\nWhat's the longest time you've ever spent shooting a scene?\\nThe longest scene I've ever shot was on this first film. It was the scene with Peeves the Poltergeist. We shot it in Gloucester Cathedral cloisters.\\nSadly it never made it to the final take although I hear Chris Columbus is going to be making a director's cut in which it will be reinstated.\\n\\nThis would have been Philosopher’s Stone, and he was played by Rik Mayall.

Was it the sheer scope of the thing?\\n[…] I loved the book so much that it was extremely difficult to cut elements out. One of my favourite characters never made the film – Peeves, the annoying, sort of, mischievous poltergeist. Those sorts of things, there was just too much to film. Our first cut of the film was about 3 hours and 20 minutes.\\n\\nAs other posters have said, Peeves didn’t play a particularly prominent role in the books: although he gets a few lines, he’s not critical to any plot points. If they were trying to shed material, you can see why Peeves would be one of the characters who gets cut.\\nAlternatively, there’s also an interview with Steve Kloves, who wrote all but one of the films, who offers his take on why Peeves was dropped in the final cut:\\n\\nOn a different note, what about some characters in the books who never appeared on screen? What ever happened to Peeves?\\nPeeves was always an issue. Chris Columbus was determined to put him in the first movie. I think there were even some technological problems with him initially, and [not] being satisfied with how he looked. He was always a bit tangential. I think [Argus] Filch, in a way, became that energy in the movies. And he was actually sort of beloved at a certain point, Filch. So I think to have Peeves, it would have felt like we were doubling up on that. It's not exactly the same but it's a bit like that. But he was a character we all loved.\\n\\n\"}},\n",

It was a very depressing afternoon. [Laughs] I remember being struck by the fragility of life here. Everyone who has grown up in the West and has been fortunate enough to live through a rather peaceful period, every year everything seems a little better. It's hard for us to imagine periods when things go backwards, but they do very, very frequently.  Just in the last 2,000 years, we can identify at last half a dozen periods in western culture where technologies were lost that ancient civilizations had that we still don't fully understand exactly, so you know that there's been knowledge lost since as early as the Middle Ages. What we know about that period survives because of beautifully transcribed manuscripts out on some rocky island on the North Sea. Although it's not our experience, it's frighteningly easy to imagine technology backsliding.\\n\\nSo it is basically an unexplained item that is in part thrown in there to indicate the downward spiral of the world.\\nThis review explains this concept:\\n\\nA script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan sets the stage, creating a near future world where crops are failing—wheat is gone, okra is on the chopping block, and all farmers can grow with any reliability is corn—and the planet is becoming a giant dustbowl.\\nThey accomplish this visually with looming sand storms, as well as through small hints, mentioning food riots, hinting at hard times in the recent past, and painting a society that needs farmers more than engineers. In all of this there are a handful of nice touches, like how the New York Yankees are basically a high school baseball team, and though you’re never sure what happened, you get enough to know that the world has changed. Better now than it was, there’s no military, and things are relatively peaceful, but they blame for the disastrous near collapse of civilization on rampant technology, like MRI machines that could have saved Coop’s wife, or wasteful spending on things like space exploration—it’s now taught in schools that the moon landing was fake.\\n\\n\"}},\n",

       "     'answer': '\\nFrom the trivia page on imdb for Traffic:\\n\\nTo achieve a distinctive look for each different vignette in the story, Steven Soderbergh used three different film stocks (and post-production techniques), each with their own color treatment and grain for the print. The \"Wakefield\" story features a colder, bluer tone to match the sad, depressive emotion. The \"Ayala\" story is bright, shiny, and saturated in primary colors, especially red, to match the glitzy surface of Helena\\'s life. The \"Mexican\" story appears grainy, rough, and hot to go with the rugged Mexican landscape and congested cities. \\n\\nFilm processing (or digital processing filters) is often used in films to convey mood/heat/other emotions.  This is all that\\'s in play here.\\nMexico is often viewed as being hot and claustrophobic - the film treatment here (and in other films) uses this to enhance the mood of the film.\\nAdditionally,\\nSoderbergh\\'s rationale for differing colour temperatures and grain effects in different strands of the story of \"Traffic\" can easily to be applied to other directors and films.  Directors can and do use film treatments, editing styles, and music in order to enhance the emotional impacts of scenes, characters, events, and entire films.\\nIt\\'s outside the scope of this answer to include exhaustive examples.  However, the main point of this answer is that directors aren\\'t likely to apply film treatements in order to convey a stereotypical perception of any particular location, although this may occasionally be the case.\\n'}},\n",

       "    '_source': {'question': 'What exactly is 70mm print and why does anyone care?',\n",
       "     'answer': '\\nThere are several orthogonal issues here:\\n\\nThe physical size of the film the movie was shot on (the negative).\\nThe physical size of the film the movie is projected from (the print).\\nHow the frame is composed on that film, which is related to the aspect ratio.\\n\\nSome of the comments and other answers are conflating various aspects, which can cause more confusion than clarification.  For example, others have implied the 70mm and IMAX are the same thing.  While it\\'s true IMAX does project from 70mm prints, 70mm prints are used in a variety of other, non-IMAX formats.\\nBefore the switch to digital, most commercial movies were shot on 35mm negatives and then distributed to theaters as 35mm or sometimes 70mm prints.  (Yes, some 70mm prints are sometimes made from 35mm masters.)\\nA few big budget, \"big screen\" movies were sometimes shot in 70mm and distributed to big theaters on 70mm prints and smaller theaters on 35mm prints.\\nThe sizes, 35mm and 70mm, refer to the width of the film itself.  This width includes the room for the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Some digital audio tracks use the spaces between the sprocket holes.  I believe (but correct me if I\\'m wrong) that magnetic audio tracks are not included in that width.\\nMost film runs through the projector vertically (big exceptions are true IMAX and VistaVision), so the width the frame is limited by the width of the film minus the width of the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Thus the width of a frame on a 35mm print is a bit narrower than 35mm.\\nThe sprocket holes are often called \"perfs,\" and many formats are thus referred to as a number of \"perfs.\"  That is, as the number of sprocket holes from one frame to the next.  A typical frame size for 35mm prints is 4-perf.  Thus the height of the frame was limited by that number.  For 70mm, I believe common formats were 7-perf, but I don\\'t have a source for that.\\nThe aspect ratio is the ratio of the width to the height.  In olden times, movies were pretty square, much like old television sets.  To compete with television, the studios introduced different aspect ratios (typically wider) in order to make the movie experience seem more immersive than television.\\nGiven that the width and height of the frame both have upper bounds, there are only a few ways to adjust the aspect ratio:\\n\\nUse less than the full height available on the frame, and use a telephoto projection lens to compensate for the diminished height.\\nShoot (or print) the frames with an anamorphic lens that squishes the image horizontally to fit it onto the film, then project with the complementary lens that stretches it back out.  This is typically done for the widest of wide-screen formats.  A telltale artifact is that lens flares appear as ovals rather than circles.\\nRun the film horizontally.  The height is limited by the film size minus sprocket holes, and the width is limited by however many perfs you choose.  This is what traditional IMAX does.  (Traditional IMAX also uses 70mm film exclusively.)\\n\\nGiven identical aspect ratios, 70mm film gives far more area per frame, which means it can be projected larger or will have better clarity and detail when projected as the same size as a comparable 35mm print.\\nSome movies are shot in a variety of formats, but mastered into a common format during editing and post production.  For example, the original Star Wars films used old VistaVision cameras for many of the motion-controlled model shots, even though everything else was probably shot with traditional cameras that ran the film vertically.\\nIn the case of this Tarantino film, I suspect it was shot on 70mm using anamorphic lenses in order to make a super-widescreen.  IMDB confirms.\\n'}},\n",

       "    '_source': {'question': 'Why does the talk show host always sit on the right?',\n",
       "     'answer': '\\nAccording to Slate:\\n\\nBecause it makes them seem powerful. In Western culture, we read from\\n  left to right, and we watch theater and television that way, too. Our\\n  eyes end up on the right side of the screen—where the host sits (also\\n  known as stage left). In the theory of stagecraft, it\\'s understood\\n  that a rightward placement telegraphs royalty. So no matter how famous\\n  the guest may be, sitting to the left makes him or her seem\\n  subservient. Late-night hosts also sit slightly upstage (farther back\\n  and slightly elevated) from their guests, which likewise reinforces\\n  the notion of a power imbalance.\\nStage designers hold that guests make a stronger impression if they\\n  enter from stage left, crossing in front of the host and shifting the\\n  audience\\'s focus ever so briefly. Perhaps that\\'s why David\\n  Letterman—famous for the occasional cutting takedown—makes his guests\\n  march in from the weaker stage right. Colbert [when he was host of Comedy Central\\'s The Colbert Report] plays with this dynamic\\n  most self-consciously. Guests wait in the interview area while Colbert\\n  makes his entrance. He keeps the focus on himself at all times.\\n\\nHowever, these days there are exceptions:\\n\\nBritish comedian James Corden made his debut as host of CBS\\' Late Late\\n  Show on Monday, promising at least one big change to the familiar U.S.\\n  late-night talk show format before he even started.\\n\"We’re gonna bring all our guests out at the same time, so all of our\\n  guests will sit together for all of the chat segments of the show,\"\\n  Corden told KPCC last week.\\n[...]\\nDuring interviews, Corden sits in an office chair to the left of his\\n  guests [...], who all share a couch.\\n  This literally puts him on the same level as the celebrities,\\n  theoretically allowing for more casual, more intimate conversation. \\n[...]\\nInterviewing without a desk, as well as inviting multiple celebrities\\n  on stage at once, is an intentional homage to iconic U.K. chat show\\n  host Graham Norton. On The Graham Norton Show, there is no desk.\\n  Norton sits to the left of his guests, who share a single long couch.\\n[...]\\nBravo\\'s raucous Watch What Happens: Live has perhaps the most unique\\n  set of any American late-night show. Not only does host Andy Cohen\\n  lack a desk, but he sits to the left of his guests. (And this is to\\n  say nothing of the on-stage bar.)\\n\\n'}},\n",
