Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.\\\\n\\\\nWe walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.\\\\n\\\\nThe Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)\\\\n\\\\nThe Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!\\\\n\\\\nThe Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...\\\\n\\\\nMy experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.\\\\n\\\\nThere is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.\\\\n\\\\nTime for a nap!\"\n",

            " b\"Me and the wifey finally made it to this place. We are big seafood/oyster fans and as most of you know there are few options for good oysters in CLT area. Oysters were good but way pricey. Everything else was an epic FAIL. Service was weak. Bartenders and servers were lethargic. Draft beer was flat. We sat in bar area at a hightop and watched beer after beer get returned for same reason. Bartender did nothing to adjust CO2. He was more concerned with the FSU-NCSU football game. Wife ordered glass of Chardonnay  and the pour on the wine was very weak as well. Maybe a 1/4 glass full. Other food besides oysters were disappointing. Salad was dry and looked old and tasted bland. Left at 6: 45 on Saturday evening and the place had 12 people inside. Unless late night rocks it out this place won't make it. Disappointing way to start a Saturday night. Two stars only because oysters were fresh and did taste good.\"\n",
            " b\"On Sundays they serve brunch until around 4, I think. Their brunch menu is a little limited compared to their regular menu, but still offers some great dishes. This is far from fine-dining, so don't come here expecting to be blown away by the creativity or presentation of the food. What it does offer, however, is bar/diner food kicked up a notch.\\\\n\\\\nDonuts: I guess for brunch they start you off w/ donuts instead of pretzel bread. I can't complain because the donuts were great.\\\\n\\\\nMini burgers: 4 big sliders. The meat was tender and delicious and the bread was heavily buttered and chewy. The side order of parmesan shoestring fries was really good -- crispy and addictive.\\\\n\\\\nPatty melt: What a great sandwich! Lots of flavor with the truffled mayo, mushrooms, and brie. The bread was amazing. It's a big sandwich also. I could only finish half of it.\\\\n\\\\nPork egg rolls: It came with 4 pieces of egg rolls deep-fried and topped w/ some slaw. The pork wasn't very tender and it was a little too spicy for me but still a decent dish.\\\\n\\\\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the space is cool and trendy and provides a good view of Treasure Island and the north part of the strip.\"]\n",

We sat in bar area at a hightop and watched beer after beer get returned for same reason. Bartender did nothing to adjust CO2. He was more concerned with the FSU-NCSU football game. Wife ordered glass of Chardonnay  and the pour on the wine was very weak as well. Maybe a 1/4 glass full. Other food besides oysters were disappointing. Salad was dry and looked old and tasted bland. Left at 6: 45 on Saturday evening and the place had 12 people inside. Unless late night rocks it out this place won't make it. Disappointing way to start a Saturday night. Two stars only because oysters were fresh and did taste good.\"\n",

            "Original:  b\"On Sundays they serve brunch until around 4, I think. Their brunch menu is a little limited compared to their regular menu, but still offers some great dishes. This is far from fine-dining, so don't come here expecting to be blown away by the creativity or presentation of the food. What it does offer, however, is bar/diner food kicked up a notch.\\\\n\\\\nDonuts: I guess for brunch they start you off w/ donuts instead of pretzel bread. I can't complain because the donuts were great.\\\\n\\\\nMini burgers: 4 big sliders. The meat was tender and delicious and the bread was heavily buttered and chewy. The side order of parmesan shoestring fries was really good -- crispy and addictive.\\\\n\\\\nPatty melt: What a great sandwich! Lots of flavor with the truffled mayo, mushrooms, and brie. The bread was amazing. It's a big sandwich also. I could only finish half of it.\\\\n\\\\nPork egg rolls: It came with 4 pieces of egg rolls deep-fried and topped w/ some slaw. The pork wasn't very tender and it was a little too spicy for me but still a decent dish.\\\\n\\\\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the space is cool and trendy and provides a good view of Treasure Island and the north part of the strip.\"\n",
